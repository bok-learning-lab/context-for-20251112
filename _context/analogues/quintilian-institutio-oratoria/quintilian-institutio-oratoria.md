QUINTILIANUS,  Marcus  Fabius  (0.35- 
c.9$  AD)  of  Calagurris  in  Spain  was 
brought  up  at  Rome,  but  was  in  Spain 
from  6 1  to  68,  when  with  the  new-made 
emperor  Galba  he  returned  to  Rome. 
There  he  became  head  of  the  most  impor- 
tant school  of  Oratory,  and  sometimes 
pleaded  in  the  law-courts.  The  emperor 
Vespasian  (69—79)  made  him  a  'Professor 
of  Latin  Rhetoric'  until  he  retired  to 
compose  a  lost  work  on  why  eloquence 
had  declined,  and  the  extant  Institutio 
Oratoria  'Training  of  an  Orator'  (in  twelve 
books).  He  was  also  teacher  to  the  em- 
peror Domitian's  two  grand-nephews. 

Quintilian  had  been  taught  by  the  famous 
Seneca  and  Domitius  of  Nimes.  He  greatly 
admired  the  long  dead  orator  Cicero, 
whom  he  saw  as  a  model  for  orators  of  his 
own  age.  His  Institutio  propounds  for  an 
orator  a  training  in  character  and  oratory 
from  birth.  He  presents  us  with  interesting 
and  important  views  on  general  education, 
deals  in  detail  with  all  oratorical  composi- 
tion and  the  devices  of  rhetoric,  and 
outlines  the  ideal  orator.  His  review  of  the 
past  literature  of  Greece  and  Rome  is 
famous  and  makes  him  a  good  literary 
critic.  The  whole  work  is  composed  in  a 
dignified  yet  pleasant  style,  and  his  judge- 
ments are  fair  and  gentle.

INTRODUCTION 

LIFE  OF  QUINTILIAN 

MARCUS  FABIUS  QUINTILIANUS  was,  like  Seneca,  of 
Spanish  origin,  being  born  about  35  A.D.  at  Cala- 
gurris.  His  father  was  a  rhetorician  of  some  note 
who  practised  with  success  at  Rome.  It  is  not  sur- 
prising therefore  to  find  that  the  young  Quintilian 
was  sent  to  Rome  for  his  education.  Among  his 
teachers  were  the  famous  grammaticus  Remmius 
Palaemon,  and  the  no  less  distinguished  rhetorician 
Domitius  Afer.  On  completing  his  education  he 
seems  to  have  returned  to  his  native  land  to  teach 
rhetoric  there,  for  we  next  hear  of  him  as  being 
brought  to  Rome  in  68  A.D.  by  Galba,  then  governor 
of  Hispania  Tarraconensis.  At  Rome  he  met  with 
great  success  as  a  teacher  and  was  the  first  rhetor- 
ician to  set  up  a  genuine  public  school  and  to  receive 
a  salary  from  the  State.  He  continued  to  teach  for 
twenty  years  and  had  among  his  pupils  the  younger 
Pliny  and  the  two  sons  of  Domitilla,  the  sister  of 
Domitian.  He  was  also  a  successful  pleader  in  the 
courts  as  we  gather  from  more  than  one  passage  in 
his  works.  Late  in  life  he  married  and  had  two 
sons.  But  both  wife  and  children  predeceased  him.

INTRODUCTION 

He  died  full  of  honour,  the  possessor  of  wide  lands 
and  consular  rank.  The  date  of  his  death  is  un- 
known, but  it  was  before  100  A.D.  He  left  behind 
him  a  treatise  "  On  the  causes  of  the  decadence  of 
Roman  oratory"  (De  causis  corruplae  eloquentiae},  the 
present  work,  and  a  speech  in  defence  of  a  certain 
Naevius  Arpinianus,  who  was  accused  of  murdering 
his  wife.  These  are  the  only  works  known  to  have 
been  actually  published  by  him,  though  others  of 
his  speeches  had  been  taken  down  in  shorthand  and 
circulated  against  his  will,  while  an  excess  of  zeal  on 
the  part  of  his  pupils  resulted  in  the  unauthorised 
publication  of  two  series  of  lecture  notes.  The 
present  work  alone  survives.  The  declamations 
which  have  come  down  to  us  under  his  name  are 
spurious.  Of  his  character  the  Instil  utio  Oratorio, 
gives  us  the  pleasantest  impression.  Humane, 
kindly  and  of  a  deeply  affectionate  nature,  gifted 
with  a  robust  common  sense  and  sound  literary 
judgment,  he  may  well  have  been  the  ideal  school- 
master. The  fulsome  references  to  Domitian  are 
the  only  blemishes  which  mar  this  otherwise  pleasing 
impression.  And  even  here  we  must  remember  his 
great  debt  to  the  Flavian  house  and  the  genuine 
difficulty  for  a  man  in  his  position  of  avoiding  the 
official  style  in  speaking  of  the  emperor. 

As  a  stylist,  though  he  is  often  difficult  owing 
to  compression  and  the  epigrammatic  turn  which  he 
gives  his  phrases,  he  is  never  affected  or  extravagant. 
He  is  still  under  the  influence  of  the  sound  traditions 
viii 


INTRODUCTION 

of  the  Ciceronian  age,  and  his  Latin  is  silver-gilt 
rather  than  silver.  His  Institutio  Oratorio,,  despite 
the  fact  that  much  of  it  is  highly  technical,  has  still 
much  that  is  of  interest  to-day,  even  for  those  who 
care  little  for  the  history  of  rhetoric.  Notably  in 
the  first  book  his  precepts  as  regards  education  have 
lasting  value  :  they  may  not  be  strikingly  original, 
but  they  are  sound,  humane  and  admirably  put.  In 
the  more  technical  portions  of  his  work  he  is  unequal ; 
the  reader  feels  that  he  cares  but  little  about  the 
minute  pedantries  of  rhetorical  technique,  and  that 
he  lacks  method  in  his  presentation  of  the  varying 
views  held  by  his  predecessors.  But  once  he  is  free  of 
such  minor  details  and  touches  on  themes  of  real 
practical  interest,  he  is  a  changed  man.  He  is  at 
times  really  eloquent,  and  always  vigorous  and 
sound,  while  throughout  the  whole  work  he  keeps 
the  same  high  ideal  unswervingly  before  him.

THE  MANUSCRIPTS 

The  MSS.  of  the  Institutio  Oratorio,  fall  into  three 
groups : — 

(1)  The  Codex  Ambrosianus  (E153),  an  eleventh-century 
MS.  now  at  Milan.    Chs.  ix.  iv.  135  to  xn.  xi.  22  are  missing. 

(2)  The  Codex  Bernensis  (351)  of  the  10th  century. 
The  Codex  Bambergensis  (M.  4,  14)  of  the  10th  century. 
The   Codex   Nostradamensis    (Paris,    Lat.    1S527)   of    the 

10th  (?)  century. 

This  group  has  the  following  lacunae  :  I.  to  i.  7  ;  v.  xiv. 
12  to  vin.  iii.  64  ;  vm.  vi.  17  to  67  ;  ix.  iii.  2  to  x.  i.  Iu7  ; 
xi.  i.  71  to  ii.  23  ;  xn.  x.  43  to  end.  The  gaps  are  to  be 
supplied  from  the  Codex  Bambergensis,  in  which  they  have 
been  filled  in  by  a  later  hand  from  a  MIS.  resembling  the 
Ambrosianus.

MARCUS  FAB1US   QUINTILIANUS  TO  HIS 
FRIEND  TRYPHO,  GREETING 

You  have  daily  importuned  me  with  the  request 
that  I  should  at  length  take  steps  to  publish  the 
book  on  the  Education  of  an  Orator  which  I  dedicated 
to  my  friend  Marcellus.  For  my  own  view  was  that 
it  was  not  yet  ripe  for  publication.  As  you  know  I 
have  spent  little  more  than  two  years  on  its  compo- 
sition, during  which  time  moreover  I  have  been  dis- 
tracted by  a  multitude  of  other  affairs.  These  two 
years  have  been  devoted  not  so  much  to  actual  writing 
as  to  the  research  demanded  by  a  task  to  which 
practically  no  limits  can  be  set  and  to  the  reading 
of  innumerable  authors.  Further,  following  the  pre-  2 
cept  of  Horace  who  in  his  Art  of  Poetry  deprecates 
hasty  publication  and  urges  the  would-be  author 

"  To  withhold 
His  work  till  nine  long  years  have  passed  away," 

I  proposed  to  give  them  time,  in  order  that  the 
ardour  of  creation  might  cool  and  that  I  might 
revise  them  with  all  the  consideration  of  a  dispas- 
sionate reader.  But  if  there  is  such  a  demand  for  3 
their  publication  as  you  assert,  why  then  let  us 
spread  our  canvas  to  the  gale  and  offer  up  a  fervent 
prayer  to  heaven  as  wre  put  out  to  sea.  But  re- 
member I  rely  on  your  loyal  care  to  see  that  they 
reach  the  public  in  as  correct  a  form  as  possible.

PROOEMIUM 

POST  impetratam  studiis  meis  quietem,  quae  per 
viginti  annos  erudiendis  iuvenibus  impenderam,  cum 
a  me  quidam  familiariter  postularent,  ut  aliquid  de 
ratione  dicendi  componerem,  diu  sum  equidem  reluc- 
tatus,  quod  auctores  utriusque  linguae  clarissimos  non 
ignorabam  multa,  quae  ad  hoc  opus  pertinerent, 

2  diligentissime  scripta    posteris   reliquisse.     Sed    qua 
ego  ex  causa  faciliorem    mihi    veniam    meae  depre- 
cationis  arbitrabar  fore,  hac  accendebantur  illi  magis, 
quod   inter  diversas   opiniones    priorum    et  quasdam 
etiam   inter   se  contrarias  difficilis  esset   electio  ;  ut

THE  INSTITUTIO  ORATORIA 
OF  QUINTILIAN 

BOOK  I 

PREFACE 

HAVING  at  length,  after  twenty  years  devoted  to 
the  training  of  the  young,  obtained  leisure  for  study, 
I  was  asked  by  certain  of  my  friends  to  write 
something  on  the  art  of  speaking.  For  a  long  time  I 
resisted  their  entreaties,  since  I  was  well  aware  that 
some  of  the  most  distinguished  Greek  and  Roman 
writers  had  bequeathed  to  posterity  a  number  of 
works  dealing  with  this  subject,  to  the  composition 
of  which  they  had  devoted  the  utmost  care.  This 
seemed  to  me  to  be  an  admirable  excuse  for  my  re- 
fusal, but  served  merely  to  increase  their  enthusiasm. 
They  urged  that  previous  writers  on  the  subject  had 
expressed  different  and  at  times  contradictory 
opinions,  between  which  it  was  very  difficult  to 
choose.  They  thought  therefore  that  they  were 
justified  in  imposing  on  me  the  task,  if  not  of 
discovering  original  views,  at  least  of  passing  definite 
judgment  on  those  expressed  by  my  predecessors. 
I  was  moved  to  comply  not  so  much  because  I 
felt  confidence  that  I  was  equal  to  the  task,  as

because  I  had  a  certain  compunction  about  refusing. 
The  subject  proved  more  extensive  than  I  had  first 
imagined  ;  but  finally  I  volunteered  to  shoulder  a 
task  which  was  on  a  far  larger  scale  than  that  which 
I  was  originally  asked  to  undertake.  I  wished  on 
the  one  hand  to  oblige  my  very  good  friends  beyond 
their  requests,  and  on  the  other  to  avoid  the  beaten 
track  and  the  necessity  of  treading  where  others 
had  gone  before.  For  almost  all  others  who  have  4 
written  on  the  art  of  oratory  have  started  with  the 
assumption  that  their  readers  were  perfect  in  all 
other  branches  of  education  and  that  their  own  task 
was  merely  to  put  the  finishing  touches  to  their 
rhetorical  training ;  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  they 
either  despised  the  preliminary  stages  of  education 
or  thought  that  they  were  not  their  concern,  since 
the  duties  of  the  different  branches  of  education 
are  distinct  one  from  another,  or  else,  and  this 
is  nearer  the  truth,  because  they  had  no  hope  of 
making  a  remunerative  display  of  their  talent  in 
dealing  with  subjects,  which,  although  necessary, 
are  far  from  being  showy  :  just  as  in  architecture  it 
is  the  superstructure  and  not  the  foundations  which 
attracts  the  eye.  I  on  the  other  hand  hold  that  the  5 
art  of  oratory  includes  all  that  is  essential  for  the 
training  of  an  orator,  and  that  it  is  impossible  to  reach 
the  summit  in  any  subject  unless  we  have  first  passed 
through  all  the  elementary  stages.  I  shall  not  there- 
fore refuse  to  stoop  to  the  consideration  of  those 
minor  details,  neglect  of  which  may  result  in  there 
being  no  opportunity  for  more  important  things,  and 
propose  to  mould  the  studies  of  my  orator  from  in- 
fancy, on  the  assumption  that  his  whole  education  has 
been  entrusted  to  my  charge.  This  work  1  dedicate  G

to  you,  Marcellus  Victorius.  You  have  been  the  truest 
of  friends  to  me  and  you  have  shown  a  passionate 
enthusiasm  for  literature.  But  good  as  these  reasons 
are,  they  are  not  the  only  reasons  that  lead  me  to 
regard  you  as  especially  worthy  of  such  a  pledge  of 
our  mutual  affection.  There  is  also  the  consideration 
that  this  book  should  prove  of  service  in  the 
education  of  your  son  Geta,  who,  young  though  he 
is,  already  shows  clear  promise  of  real  talent.  It  has 
been  my  design  to  lead  my  reader  from  the  very 
cradle  of  speech  through  all  the  stages  of  education 
which  can  be  of  any  service  to  our  budding  orator 
till  we  have  reached  the  very  summit  of  the  art.  I  7 
have  been  all  the  more  desirous  of  so  doing  because 
two  books  on  the  art  of  rhetoric  are  at  present 
circulating  under  my  name,  although  never  published 
by  me  or  composed  for  such  a  purpose.  One  is  a 
two  days'  lecture  which  was  taken  down  by  the  boys 
who  were  my  audience.  The  other  consists  of  such 
notes  as  my  good  pupils  succeeded  in  taking  down 
from  a  course  of  lectures  on  a  somewhat  more 
extensive  scale :  I  appreciate  their  kindness,  but 
they  showed  an  excess  of  enthusiasm  and  a  certain 
lack  of  discretion  in  doing  my  utterances  the  honoui 
of  publication.  Consequently  in  the  present  work  8 
although  some  passages  remain  the  same,  you  will 
find  many  alterations  and  still  more  additions,  while 
the  whole  theme  will  be  treated  with  greater  system 
and  with  as  great  perfection  as  lies  within  my 
power. 

My  aim,  then,  is   the   education   of  the    perfect  9 
orator.     The  first  essential  for  such  an  one  is  that  he 
should  be  a  good  man,  and  consequently  we  demand 
of  him   not   merely   the   possession   of  exceptional

gifts  of  speech,  but  of  all  the  excellences  of  character 
as  well.  For  I  will  not  admit  that  the  principles  of  10 
upright  and  honourable  living  should,  as  some  have 
held,  be  regarded  as  the  peculiar  concern  of  philo- 
sophy. The  man  who  can  really  play  his  part  as  a 
citizen  and  is  capable  of  meeting  the  demands  both 
of  public  and  private  business,  the  man  who  can 
guide  a  state  by  his  counsels,  give  it  a  firm  basis  by 
his  legislation  and  purge  its  vices  by  his  decisions  as 
a  judge,  is  assuredly  no  other  than  the  orator  of  our 
quest.  Wherefore,  although  I  admit  I  shall  make  11 
use  of  certain  of  the  principles  laid  down  in  philo- 
sophical textbooks,  I  would  insist  that  such  principles 
have  a  just  claim  to  form  part  of  the  subject-matter 
of  this  work  and  do  actually  belong  to  the  art  of 
oratory.  I  shall  frequently  be  compelled  to  speak  of  1. 
such  virtues  as  courage,  justice,  self-control;  in  fact 
scarcely  a  case  comes  up  in  which  some  one  of  these 
virtues  is  not  involved  ;  every  one  of  them  requires 
illustration  and  consequently  makes  a  demand  on 
the  imagination  and  eloquence  of  the  pleader.  I 
ask  you  then,  can  there  be  any  doubt  that,  wherever 
imaginative  power  and  amplitude  of  diction  are  re- 
quired, the  orator  has  a  specially  important  part  to 
play?  These  two  branches  of  knowledge  w.ere,  as  13 
Cicero  has  clearly  shown,1  so  closely  united,  not 
merely  in  theory  but  in  practice,  that  the  same  men 
were  regarded  as  uniting  the  qualifications  of  orator 
and  philosopher.  Subsequently  this  single  branch 
of  study  split  up  into  its  component  parts,  and 
thanks  to  the  indolence  of  its  professors  was  re- 
garded as  consisting  of  several  distinct  subjects. 
As  soon  as  speaking  became  a  means  of  livelihood 
and  the  practice  of  making  an  evil  use  of  the

blessings  of  eloquence  came  into  vogue,  those  who 
had  a  reputation  for  eloquence  ceased  to  study  moral 
philosophy,  and  ethics,  thus  abandoned  by  the  14 
orators,  became  the  prey  of  weaker  intellects.  As 
a  consequence  certain  persons,  disdaining  the  toil  of 
learning  to  speak  well,  returned  to  the  task  of 
forming  character  and  establishing  rules  of  life  and 
kept  to  themselves  what  is,  if  we  must  make  a 
division,  the  better  part  of  philosophy,  but  pre- 
sumptuously laid  claim  to  the  sole  possession  of  the 
title  of  philosopher,  a  distinction  which  neither  the 
greatest  generals  nor  the  most  famous  statesmen 
and  administrators  have  ever  dared  to  claim  for  them- 
selves. For  they  preferred  the  performance  to  the 
promise  of  great  deeds.  I  am  ready  to  admit  that  15 
many  of  the  old  philosophers  inculcated  the  most  ex- 
cellent principles  and  practised  what  they  preached. 
But  in  our  own  day  the  name  of  philosopher  has 
too  often  been  the  mask  for  the  worst  vices.  For 
their  attempt  has  not  been  to  win  the  name  of 
philosopher  by  virtue  and  the  earnest  search  for 
wisdom  ;  instead  they  have  sought  to  disguise  the 
depravity  of  their  characters  by  the  assumption 
of  a  stern  and  austere  mien  accompanied  by  the 
wearing  of  a  garb  differing  from  that  of  their  fellow 
men.  Now  as  a  matter  of  fact  we  all  of  us  frequently  16 
handle  those  themes  which  philosophy  claims  for  its 
own.  Who,  short  of  being  an  utter  villain,  does  not 
speak  of  justice,  equity  and  virtue  ?  Who  (and  even 
common  country-folk  are  no  exception)  does  not 
make  some  inquiry  into  the  causes  of  natural  phe- 
nomena ?  As  for  the  special  uses  and  distinctions  of 
words,  they  should  be  a  subject  of  study  common  to 
all  who  give  any  thought  to  the  meaning  of  language.

But  it  is  surely  the  orator  who  will  have  the  greatest  17 
mastery  of  all  such  departments  of  knowledge  and 
the  greatest  power  to  express  it  in  words.  Arid  if  ever 
lie  had  reached  perfection,  there  would  be  no  need 
to  go  to  the  schools  of  philosophy  for  the  precepts  of 
virtue.  As  things  stand,  it  is  occasionally  necessary 
to  have  recourse  to  those  authors  who  have,  as  I 
said  above,  usurped  the  better  part  of  the  art  of 
oratory  after  its  desertion  by  the  orators  and  to 
demand  back  what  is  ours  by  right,  not  with  a  view 
to  appropriating  their  discoveries,  but  to  show  them 
that  they  have  appropriated  what  in  truth  belonged 
to  others.  Let  our  ideal  orator  then  be  such  as  to  is 
have  a  genuine  title  to  the  name  of  philosopher  :  it 
is  not  sufficient  that  he  should  be  blameless  in  point 
of  character  (for  I  cannot  agree  with  those  who  hold 
this  opinion)  :  he  must  also  be  a  thorough  master  of 
the  science  and  the  art  of  speaking,  to  an  extent 
that  perhaps  no  orator  has  yet  attained.  Still  we  iy 
must  none  the  less  follow  the  ideal,  as  was  done  by 
not  a  few  of  the  ancients,  who,  though  they  refused 
to  admit  that  the  perfect  sage  had  yet  been  found, 
none  the  less  handed  down  precepts  of  wisdom  for 
the  use  of  posterity.  Perfect  eloquence  is  assuredly  20 
a  reality,  which  is  not  beyond  the  reach  of  human 
intellect.  Even  if  we  fail  to  reach  it,  those  whose 
aspirations  are  highest,  will  attain  to  greater  heights 
than  those  who  abandon  themselves  to  premature 
despair  of  ever  reaching  the  goal  and  halt  at  the 
very  foot  of  the  ascent. 

I  have  therefore  all  the  juster  claim  to  indulgence,  21 
if  I  refuse  to  pass  by  those  minor  details  which  are 
none  the  less  essential  to  my  task.      My  first  book 
will  be  concerned  with  the  education  preliminary  to

the  duties  of  the  teacher  of  rhetoric.  Mj-o  the  edu- 
deal  with  the  rudiments  of  the  schools  u^  to  say 
and  with  problems  connected  with  the  esse  book 
rhetoric  itself.  The  next  five  will  be

The  four  following  will  be  assigned  to    Eloquence*. 
under  which  head   I   include   Memory  and  Delivery. 
Finally  there  will  be  one  book  in  which  our  com- 

* 

plete  orator  will  be  delineated  ;  as  far  as  my  feeble 
powers  permit,  I  shall  discuss  his  character,  the 
rules  which  should  guide  him  in  undertaking, 
studying  and  pleading  cases,  the  style  of  his  elo- 
quence, the  time  at  which  he  should  cease  to  plead 
cases  and  the  studies  to  which  he  should  devote 
himself  after  such  cessation.  In  the  course  of  these  23 
discussions  I  shall  deal  in  its  proper  place  with 
the  method  of  teaching  by  which  students  will 
acquire  not  merely  a  knowledge  of  those  things 
to  which  the  name  of  art  is  restricted  by  certain 
theorists,  and  will  not  only  come  to  understand  the 
laws  of  rhetoric,  but  will  acquire  that  which  will 
increase  their  powers  of  speech  and  nourish  their 
eloquence.  For  as  a  rule  the  result  of  the  dry  text-  24 
books  on  the  art  of  rhetoric  is  that  by  straining 
after  excessive  subtlety  they  impair  and  cripple 
all  the  nobler  elements  of  style,  exhaust  the  life- 
blood  of  the  imagination  and  leave  but  the  bare 
bones,  which,  while  it  is  right  and  necessary  that 
they  should  exist  and  be  bound  each  to  each  by 
their  respective  ligaments,  require  a  covering  of  flesh 
as  well.  I  shall  therefore  avoid  the  precedent  set  25 
by  the  majority  and  shall  not  restrict  myself  to  this 
narrow  conception  of  my  theme,  but  shall  include  in 
my  twelve  books  a  brief  demonstration  of  everything

which  may  seem  likely  to  contribute  to  the  edu- 
cation of  an  orator.  For  if  I  were  to  attempt  to  say 
all  that  might  be  said  on  each  subject,  the  book 
would  never  be  finished. 

There  is  however  one  point  which  I  must  em-  26 
phasise  before  I  begin,  which  is  this.  Without 
natural  gifts  technical  rules  are  useless.  Conse- 
quently the  student  who  is  devoid  of  talent  will 
derive  no  more  profit  from  this  work  than  barren 
soil  from  a  treatise  on  agriculture.  There  are,  it  is  27 
true,  other  natural  aids,  such  as  the  possession  of  a 
good  voice  and  robust  lungs,  sound  health,  powers  of 
endurance  and  grace,  and  if  these  are  possessed  only 
to  a  moderate  extent,  they  may  be  improved  by 
methodical  training.  In  some  cases,  however,  these 
gifts  are  lacking  to  such  an  extent  that  their  absence 
is  fatal  to  all  such  advantages  as  talent  and  study 
can  confer,  while,  similarly,  they  are  of  no  profit  in 
themselves  unless  cultivated  by  skilful  teaching,  per- 
sistent study  and  continuous  and  extensive  practice 
in  writing,  reading  and  speaking. 

I.  I  would,  therefore,  have  a  father  conceive  the 
highest  hopes  of  his  son  from  the  moment  of  his 
birth.  If  he  does  so,  he  will  be  more  careful  about 
the  groundwork  of  his  education.  For  there  is 
absolutely  no  foundation  for  the  complaint  that  but 
few  men  have  the  power  to  take  in  the  knowledge 
that  is  imparted  to  them,  and  that  the  majority  are 
so  slow  of  understanding  that  education  is  a  waste 
of  time  and  labour.  On  the  contrary  you  will  find 
that  most  are  quick  to  reason  and  ready  to  learn. 
Reasoning  comes  as  naturally  to  man  as  flying  to 
birds,  speed  to  horses  and  ferocity  to  beasts  of  prey  :

our  minds  are  endowed  by  nature  with  such  activity 
and  sagacity  that  the  soul  is  believed  to  proceed 
from  heaven.  Those  who  are  dull  and  unteachable  2 
are  as  abnormal  as  prodigious  births  and  monstrosi- 
ties, and  are  but  few  in  number.  A  proof  of  what 
I  say  is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that  boys  commonly 
show  promise  of  many  accomplishments,  and  when 
such  promise  dies  away  as  they  grow  up,  this  is 
plainly  due  not  to  the  failure  of  natural  gifts,  but  to 
lack  of  the  requisite  care.  But,  it  will  be  urged, 
there  are  degrees  of  talent.  Undoubtedly,  I  reply,  3 
and  there  will  be  a  corresponding  variation  in  actual 
accomplishment:  but  that  there  are  any  who  gain 
nothing  from  education,  I  absolutely  deny.  The 
man  who  shares  this  conviction,  must,  as  soon  as  he 
becomes  a  father,  devote  the  utmost  care  to  foster- 
ing the  promise  shown  by  the  son  whom  he  destines 
to  become  an  orator. 

Above  all  see  that  the  child's  nurse  speaks  4 
correctly.  The  ideal,  according  to  Chrysippus, 
would  be  that  she  should  be  a  philosopher :  failing 
that  he  desired  that  the  best  should  be  chosen,  as 
far  as  possible.  No  doubt  the  most  important  point 
is  that  they  should  be  of  good  character :  but  they 
should  speak  correctly  as  well.  It  is  the  nurse  that  6 
the  child  first  hears,  and  her  words  that  he  will  first 
attempt  to  imitate.  And  we  are  by  nature  most 
tenacious  of  childish  impressions,  just  as  the  flavour 
first  absorbed  by  vessels  when  new  persists,  and  the 
colour  imparted  by  dyes  to  the  primitive  whiteness 
of  wool  is  indelible.  Further  it  is  the  worst 
impressions  that  are  most  durable.  For,  while  what 
is  good  readily  deteriorates,  you  will  never  turn  vice

into  virtue.  Do  not  therefore  allow  the  boy  to 
become  accustomed  even  in  infancy  to  a  style  of 
speech  which  he  will  subsequently  have  to  unlearn. 

As  regards  parents,  I  should  like  to  see  them  as  6 
highly  educated  as  possible,  and  I  do  not  restrict  this 
remark  to  fathers  alone.  We  are  told  that  the 
eloquence  of  the  Gracchi  owed  much  to  their 
mother  Cornelia,  whose  letters  even  to-day  testify  to 
the  cultivation  of  her  style.  Laelia,  the  daughter 
of  Gaius  Laelius,  is  said  to  have  reproduced  the 
elegance  of  her  father's  language  in  her  own  speech, 
while  the  oration  delivered  before  the  triumvirs  by 
Hortensia,  the  daughter  of  Quintus  Hortensius,  is 
still  read  and  not  merely  as  a  compliment  to  her  sex. 
And  even  those  who  have  not  had  the  fortune  to  7 
receive  a  good  education  should  not  for  that  reason 
devote  less  care  to  their  son's  education  ;  but  should 
on  the  contrary  show  all  the  greater  diligence  in 
other  matters  where  they  can  be  of  service  to  their 
children. 

As  regards  the  boys  in  whose  company  our  budding  8 
orator  is  to  be  brought  up,  I  would  repeat  what 
I  have  said  about  nurses.  As  regards  his  paedagogi,1 
I  would  urge  that  they  should  have  had  a  thorough 
education,  or  if  they  have  not,  that  they  should  be 
aware  of  the  fact.  There  are  none  worse  than 
those,  who  as  soon  as  they  have  progressed  beyond 
a  knowledge  of  the  alphabet  delude  themselves 
into  the  belief  that  they  are  the  possessors  of  real 
knowledge.  For  they  disdain  to  stoop  to  the 
drudgery  of  teaching,  and  conceiving  that  they 
have  acquired  a  certain  title  to  authority — a  frequent 
source  of  vanity  in  such  persons — become  imperious 
or  even  brutal  in  instilling  a  thorough  dose  of  their

own  folly.  Their  misconduct  is  no  less  prejudicial  9 
to  morals.  We  are,  for  instance,  told  by  Diogenes 
of  Babylon,  that  Leonides,  Alexander's  paedagogus, 
infected  his  pupil  with  certain  faults,  which  as  a 
result  of  his  education  as  a  boy  clung  to  him  even  in 
his  maturer  years  when  he  had  become  the  greatest 
of  kings. 

If  any  of  my  readers  regards  me  as  somewhat  10 
exacting  in  my  demands,  I  would  ask  him  to  reflect 
that  it  is  no  easy  task  to  create  an  orator,  even 
though  his  education  be  carried  out  under  the  most 
favourable  circumstances,  and  that  further  and 
greater  difficulties  are  still  before  us.  For  con- 
tinuous application,  the  very  best  of  teachers  and 
a  variety  of  exercises  are  necessary.  Therefore  the  11 
rules  which  we  lay  down  for  the  education  of  our 
pupil  must  be  of  the  best.  If  anyone  refuses  to  be 
guided  by  them,  the  fault  will  lie  not  with  the 
method,  but  with  the  individual.  Still  if  it  should 
prove  impossible  to  secure  the  ideal  nurse,  the  ideal 
companions,  or  the  ideal  paedagogus,  I  wrould  insist 
that  there  should  be  one  person  af  any  rate  attached 
to  the  boy  who  has  some  knowledge  of  speaking 
and  who  will,  if  any  incorrect  expression  should  be 
used  by  nurse  or  paedagogus  in  the  presence  of 
the  child  under  their  charge,  at  once  correct  the 
error  and  prevent  its  becoming  a  habit.  But  it  must 
be  clearly  understood  that  this  is  only  a  remedy,  and 
that  the  ideal  course  is  that  indicated  above. 

I    prefer  that   a    boy  should    begin    with    Greek,  12 
because  Latin,  being  in  general  use,  will  be  picked 
up  by  him  whether  we  will  or  no ;  while  the  fact 
that    Latin    learning    is    derived    from    Greek    is    a 
further  reason  for  his  being  first  instructed  in  the

latter.  I  do  not  however  desire  that  this  principle  13 
should  be  so  superstitiously  observed  that  he  should 
for  long  speak  and  learn  only  Greek,  as  is  done  in  the 
majority  of  cases.  Such  a  course  gives  rise  to  many 
faults  of  language  and  accent ;  the  latter  tends  to 
acquire  a  foreign  intonation,  while  the  former 
through  force  of  habit  becomes  impregnated  with 
Greek  idioms,  which  persist  with  extreme  obstinacy 
even  when  we  are  speaking  another  tongue.  The  14 
study  of  Latin  ought  therefore  to  follow  at  no  great 
distance  and  in  a  short  time  proceed  side  by  side 
with  Greek.  The  result  will  be  that,  as  soon  as  we 
begin  to  give  equal  attention  to  both  languages, 
neither  will  prove  a  hindrance  to  the  other. 

Some    hold   that    boys    should    not   be  taught  to  15 
read  till  they  are   seven  years  old,  that  being  the 
earliest   age  at  which  they  can  derive    profit    from 
instruction  and  endure  the  strain  of  learning.     Most 
of  them  attribute  this  view  to  Hesiod,  at  least  such 
as  lived  before  the  time  of  Aristophanes  the  gram- 
marian, who  was  the    first   to   deny    that   the  Hy- 
polhecae,1  in  which  this  opinion  is  expressed,  was  the 
work  of  that  poet.      But  other  authorities,  among  16 
them    Eratosthenes,  give  the   same  advice.     Those 
however  who  hold  that  a  child's  mind  should  not  be 
allowed    to    lie    fallow    for    a    moment   are    wiser. 
Chrysippus,  for  instance,  though  he  gives  the  nurses 
a    three  years'   reign,   still    holds    the  formation    of 
the  child's  mind  011  the  best  principles  to  be  a  part 
of  their   duties.        Why,   again,  since    children    are  17 
capable    of    moral    training,    should    they    not    be 
capable   of  literary   education?       I    am  well    aware 
that  during  the  whole  period  of  which  I  am  speaking 
we  can  expect  scarcely  the  same  amount  of  progress

that  one  year  will  effect  afterwards.  Still  those  who 
disagree  with  me  seem  in  taking  this  line  to  spare 
the  teacher  rather  than  the  pupil.  What  better  is 
occupation  can  a  child  have  so  soon  as  he  is  able  to 
speak  ?  And  he  must  be  kept  occupied  somehow  or 
other.  Or  why  should  we  despise  the  profit  to  be 
derived  before  the  age  of  seven,  small  though  it  be  ? 
For  though  the  knowledge  absorbed  in  the  previous 
years  may  be  but  little,  yet  the  boy  will  be  learning 
something  more  advanced  during  that  year,  in  which 
he  would  otherwise  have  been  occupied  with  some- 
thing more  elementary.  Such  progress  each  sue-  19 
cessive  year  increases  the  total,  and  the  time  gained 
during  childhood  is  clear  profit  to  the  period  of 
youth.  Further  as  regards  the  years  which  follow 
I  must  emphasise  the  importance  of  learning  what 
has  to  be  learnt  in  good  time.  Let  us  not  therefore 
waste  the  earliest  years  :  there  is  all  the  less  excuse 
for  this,  since  the  elements  of  literary  training  are 
solely  a  question  of  memory,  which  not  only  exists 
even  in  small  children,  but  is  specially  retentive  at 
that  age. 

I  am  not  however  so  blind  to  differences  of  age  20 
as  to  think  that  the  very  young  should  be  forced  on 
prematurely  or  given  real  work  to  do.  Above  all 
things  we  must  take  care  that  the  child,  who  is  not 
yet  old  enough  to  love  his  studies,  does  not  come  to 
hate  them  and  dread  the  bitterness  which  he  has 
once  tasted,  even  when  the  years  of  infancy  are 
left  behind.  His  studies  must  be  made  an  amuse- 
ment :  he  must  be  questioned  and  praised  and 
taught  to  rejoice  when  he  has  done  well ;  sometimes 
too,  when  he  refuses  instruction,  it  should  be  given 
to  some  other  to  excite  his  envy,  at  times  also  he

must  be  engaged  in  competition  and  should  be 
allowed  to  believe  himself  successful  more  often  than 
not,  while  he  should  be  encouraged  to  do  his  best  by 
such  rewards  as  may  appeal  to  his  tender  years. 

These   instructions   may  seem    but   trivialities   in  21 
view  of  the  fact  that  I  am  professing  to  describe  the 
education  of  an  orator.      But  studies,  like  men,  have 
their  infancy,  and  as  the  training  of  the  body  which 
is  destined  to  grow  to  the  fulness  of  strength  begins 
while  the  child  is  in  his  cradle  and  at  his  mother's 
breast,  so  even  the  man  who  is  destined  to  rise  to 
the  heights  of  eloquence  was  once  a  squalling  babe, 
tried    to   speak    in    stammering    accents    and    was 
puzzled   by  the  shapes  of  letters.      Nor  does   the 
fact  that  capacity  for  learning  is  inadequate,  prove 
that   it    is    not    necessary   to   learn    anything.      No  22 
one  blames  a  father  because    he   thinks   that    such 
details  should   on  no  account  be  neglected  in    the 
case  of  his  own  son.     Why  then  should  he  be  crit- 
icised who  sets  down  for  the  benefit  of  the  public 
what  he  would  be  right  to  put  into  practice  in  his 
own  house  ?     There  is  this  further  reason  why  he 
should  not  be  blamed.     Small  children  are    better 
adapted  for  taking  in  small  things,  and  just  as  the 
body  can  only  be  trained  to  certain  flexions  of  the 
limbs  while  it  is  young  and  supple,  so  the  acquisition 
of  strength  makes  the  mind  offer  greater  resistance 
to  the   acquisition   of  most  subjects   of  knowledge. 
Would  Philip  of  Macedon  have  wished  that  his  son  23 
Alexander  should  be  taught  the  rudiments  of  letters 
by  Aristotle,  the  greatest  philosopher  of  that  age,  or 
would  the  latter  have  undertaken  the  task,  if  he  had 
not  thought  that  even  the  earliest  instruction  is  best 
given    by    the    most    perfect   teacher   and    has  real

reference  to  the  whole  of  education  ?  Let  us  assume  24 
therefore  that  Alexander  has  been  confided  to  our 
charge  and  that  the  infant  placed  in  our  lap  deserves 
no  less  attention  than  he — though  for  that  matter 
every  man's  child  deserves  equal  attention.  Would 
you  be  ashamed  even  in  teaching  him  the  alphabet 
to  point  out  some  brief  rules  for  his  education  ? 

At  any  rate  I  am  not  satisfied  with  the  course 
(which  I  note  is  usually  adopted)  of  teaching  small 
children  the  names  and  order  of  the  letters  before 
their  shapes.  Such  a  practice  makes  them  slow  25 
to  recognise  the  letters,  since  they  do  not  pay 
attention  to  their  actual  shape,  preferring  to  be 
guided  by  what  they  have  already  learned  by 
rote.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  teachers,  when 
they  think  they  have  sufficiently  familiarised  their 
young  pupils  with  the  letters  written  in  their 
usual  order,  reverse  that  order  or  rearrange  it  in 
every  kind  of  combination,  until  they  learn  to  know 
the  letters  from  their  appearance  and  not  from 
the  order  in  which  they  occur.  It  will  be  best 
therefore  for  children  to  begin  by  learning  their 
appearance  and  names  just  as  they  do  with  men. 
The  method,  however,  to  which  we  have  objected  in  26 
teaching  the  alphabet,  is  unobjectionable  when 
applied  to  syllables.  1  quite  approve  on  the  other 
hand  of  a  practice  which  has  been  devised  to 
stimulate  children  to  learn  by  giving  them  ivory 
letters  to  play  with,  as  I  do  of  anything  else  that 
may  be  discovered  to  delight  the  very  young,  the 
sight,  handling  and  naming  of  which  is  a  pleasure. 

As    soon    as    the  child    has    begun  to    know    the  27 
shapes  of  the  various  letters,  it  will  be  no  bad  thing 
to  have  them  cut  as  accurately  as  possible  upon  a

board,  so  that  the  pen  may  be  guided  along  the 
grooves.  Thus  mistakes  such  as  occur  with  wax 
tablets  will  be  rendered  impossible ;  for  the  pen 
will  be  confined  between  the  edges  of  the  letters 
and  will  be  prevented  from  going  astray.  Further 
by  increasing  the  frequency  and  speed  with  which 
they  follow  these  fixed  outlines  we  shall  give  steadi- 
ness to  the  fingers,  and  there  will  be  no  need  to 
guide  the  child's  hand  with  our  own.  The  art  of  28 
writing  well  and  quickly  is  not  unimportant  for  our 
purpose,  though  it  is  generally  disregarded  by  persons 
of  quality.  Writing  is  of  the  utmost  importance 
in  the  study  which  we  have  under  consideration  and 
by  its  means  alone  can  true  and  deeply  rooted 
proficiency  be  obtained.  But  a  sluggish  pen  delays 
our  thoughts,  while  an  unformed  and  illiterate  hand 
cannot  be  deciphered,  a  circumstance  which  ne- 
cessitates another  wearisome  task,  namely  the  dic- 
tation of  what  we  have  written  to  a  copyist.  We  shall  29 
therefore  at  all  times  and  in  all  places,  and  above  all 
when  we  are  writing  private  letters  to  our  friends, 
find  a  gratification  in  the  thought  that  we  have  not 
neglected  even  this  accomplishment. 

As  regards  syllables,  no  short  cut  is  possible  :  they  30 
must  all  be  learnt,  and  there  is  no  good  in  putting 
off  learning  the  most  difficult ;  this  is  the  general 
practice,  but  the  sole  result  is  bad  spelling.  Further  31 
we  must  beware  of  placing  a  blind  confidence  in  a 
child's  memory.  It  is  better  to  repeat  syllables  and 
impress  them  on  the  memory  and,  when  he  is 
reading,  not  to  press  him  to  read  continuously  or 
with  greater  speed,  unless  indeed  the  clear  and 
obvious  sequence  of  letters  can  suggest  itself  without 
its  being  necessary  for  the  child  to  stop  to  think.

The  syllables  once  learnt,  let  him  begin  to  construct 
words  with  them  and  sentences  with  the  words. 
You  will  hardly  believe  how  much  reading  is  delayed  32 
by  undue  haste.  If  the  child  attempts  more  than 
his  powers  allow,  the  inevitable  result  is  hesitation, 
interruption  and  repetition,  and  the  mistakes  which 
he  makes  merely  lead  him  to  lose  confidence  in  what 
he  already  knows.  Reading  must  therefore  first  be  33 
sure,  then  connected,  while  it  must  be  kept  slow  for 
a  considerable  time,  until  practice  brings  speed 
unaccompanied  by  error.  For  to  look  to  the  right,  34 
which  is  regularly  taught,  and  to  look  ahead  de- 
pends not  so  much  on  precept  as  on  practice  ;  since 
it  is  necessary  to  keep  the  eyes  on  what  follows 
while  reading  out  what  precedes,  with  the  result- 
ing difficulty  that  the  attention  of  the  mind  must 
be  divided,  the  eyes  and  voice  being  differently  en- 
gaged. It  will  be  found  worth  while,  when  the  boy 
begins  to  write  out  words  in  accordance  with  the 
usual  practice,  to  see  that  he  does  not  waste  his 
labour  in  writing  out  common  words  of  everyday 
occurrence.  He  can  readily  learn  the  explanations  35 
or  glosses,  as  the  Greeks  call  them,  of  the  more 
obscure  words  by  the  way  and,  while  he  is  still  en- 
gaged on  the  first  rudiments,  acquire  what  would 
otherwise  demand  special  time  to  be  devoted  to  it. 
And  as  we  are  still  discussing  minor  details,  I  would 
urge  that  the  lines,  which  he  is  set  to  copy,  should 
not  express  thoughts  of  no  significance,  but  convey 
some  sound  moral  lesson.  He  will  remember  such  36 
aphorisms  even  when  he  is  an  old  man,  and  the  im- 
pression made  upon  his  unformed  mind  will  contribute 
to  the  formation  of  his  character.  He  may  also  be 
entertained  by  learning  the  sayings  of  famous  men

and  above  all  selections  from  the  poets,  poetry  being 
more  attractive  to  children.  For  memory  is  most  ne- 
cessary to  an  orator,  as  I  shall  point  out  in  its  proper 
place,  and  there  is  nothing  like  practice  for  strength- 
ening and  developing  it.  And  at  the  tender  age 
of  which  we  are  now  speaking,  when  originality  is 
impossible,  memory  is  almost  the  only  faculty  which 
can  be  developed  by  the  teacher.  It  will  be  worth  37 
while,  by  way  of  improving  the  child's  pronunciation 
and  distinctness  of  utterance,  to  make  him  rattle 
off  a  selection  of  names  and  lines  of  studied  difficulty: 
they  should  be  formed  of  a  number  of  syllables 
which  go  ill  together  and  should  be  harsh  and 
rugged  in  sound :  the  Greeks  call  them  "  gags." 
This  sounds  a  trifling  matter,  but  its  omission  will 
result  in  numerous  faults  of  pronunciation,  which, 
unless  removed  in  early  years,  will  become  a  perverse 
and  incurable  habit  and  persist  through  life. 

II.  But  the  time  has  come  for  the  boy  to  grow  up 
little  by  little,  to  leave  the  nursery  and  tackle  his 
studies  in  good  earnest.  This  therefore  is  the  place 
to  discuss  the  question  as  to  whether  it  is  better  to 
have  him  educated  privately  at  home  or  hand  him 
over  to  some  large  school  and  those  whom  I  may 
call  public  instructors.  The  latter  course  has,  I  2 
know,  won  the  approval  of  most  eminent  authorities 
and  of  those  who  have  formed  the  national  character 
of  the  most  famous  states.  It  would,  however,  be  folly 
to  shut  our  eyes  to  the  fact  that  there  are  some  who 
disagree  with  this  preference  for  public  education 
owing  to  a  certain  prejudice  in  favour  of  private 
tuition.  These  persons  seem  to  be  guided  in  the 
main  by  two  principles.  In  the  interests  of  morality 
they  would  avoid  the  society  of  a  number  of  human

beings  at  an  age  that  is  specially  liable  to  acquire 
serious  faults  :  I  only  wish  I  could  deny  the  truth  of 
the  view  that  such  education  has  often  been  the 
cause  of  the  most  discreditable  actions.  Secondly 
they  hold  that  whoever  is  to  be  the  boy's  teacher,  he 
will  devote  his  time  more  generously  to  one  pupil 
than  if  he  has  to  divide  it  among  several.  The  first  3 
reason  certainly  deserves  serious  consideration.  If 
it  were  proved  that  schools,  while  advantageous 
to  study,  are  prejudicial  to  morality,  I  should  give 
my  vote  for  virtuous  living  in  preference  to  even 
supreme  excellence  of  speaking.  But  in  my  opinion 
the  two  are  inseparable.  I  hold  that  no  one  can  be 
a  true  orator  unless  he  is  also  a  good  man  and, 
even  if  he  could  be,  I  would  not  have  it  so.  I  will 
therefore  deal  with  this  point  first. 

It  is  held  that  schools  corrupt  the  morals.  It  is  4 
true  that  this  is  sometimes  the  case.  But  morals 
may  be  corrupted  at  home  as  well.  There  are 
numerous  instances  of  both,  as  there  are  also  of 
the  preservation  of  a  good  reputation  under  either 
circumstance.  The  nature  of  the  individual  boy 
and  the  care  devoted  to  his  education  make  all  the 
difference.  Given  a  natural  bent  toward  evil  or 
negligence  in  developing  and  watching  over  modest 
behaviour  in  early  years,  privacy  will  provide  equal 
opportunity  for  sin.  The  teacher  employed  at 
home  may  be  of  bad  character,  and  there  is  just  as 
much  danger  in  associating  with  bad  slaves  as  there 
is  with  immodest  companions  of  good  birth.  On  the  5 
other  hand  if  the  natural  bent  be  towards  virtue, 
and  parents  are  not  afflicted  with  a  blind  and  torpid 
indifference,  it  is  possible  to  choose  a  teacher  of  the 
highest  character  (and  those  who  are  wise  will  make

this  their  first  object),  to  adopt  a  method  of  edu- 
cation of  the  strictest  kind  and  at  the  same  time  to 
attach  some  respectable  man  or  faithful  freed  man  to 
their  son  as  his  friend  and  guardian,  that  his  un- 
failing companionship  may  improve  the  character 
even  of  those  who  gave  rise  to  apprehension. 

Yet  how  easy  were  the  remedy  for  such  fears.  6 
Would  that  we  did  not  too  often  ruin  our  children's 
character  ourselves !  We  spoil  them  from  the 
cradle.  That  soft  upbringing,  which  we  call  kind- 
ness, saps  all  the  sinews  both  of  mind  and  body.  If 
the  child  crawls  on  purple,  what  will  he  not  desire 
when  he  comes  to  manhood  ?  Before  he  can  talk  he 
can  distinguish  scarlet  and  cries  for  the  very  best 
brand  of  purple.  We  train  their  palates  before  we 
teach  their  lips  to  speak.  They  grow  up  in  litters  :  7 
if  they  set  foot  to  earth,  they  are  supported  by  the 
hands  of  attendants  on  either  side.  We  rejoice  if 
they  say  something  over-free,  and  words  which  we 
should  not  tolerate  from  the  lips  even  of  an  Alexan- 
drian page  are  greeted  with  laughter  and  a  kiss. 
We  have  no  right  to  be  surprised.  It  was  we  that 
taught  them  :  they  hear  us  use  such  words,  they  see  8 
our  mistresses  and  minions  ;  every  dinner  party  is 
loud  with  foul  songs,  and  things  are  presented  to 
their  eyes  of  which  we  should  blush  to  speak. 
Hence  springs  habit,  and  habit  in  time  becomes 
second  nature.  The  poor  children  learn  these  things 
before  they  know  them  to  be  wrong.  They  become 
luxurious  and  effeminate,  and  far  from  acquiring 
such  vices  at  schools,  introduce  them  themselves. 

I  now  turn  to  the  objection  that  one  master  can    9 
give  more  attention  to  one  pupil.      In  the  first  place 
there  is   nothing  to  prevent  the  principle  of  "  one

teacher,  one  boy "  being  combined  with  school 
education.  And  even  if  such  a  combination  should 
prove  impossible,  I  should  still  prefer  the  broad 
daylight  of  a  respectable  school  to  the  solitude  and 
obscurity  of  a  private  education.  For  all  the  best 
teachers  pride  themselves  on  having  a  large  number 
of  pupils  and  think  themselves  worthy  of  a  bigger 
audience.  On  the  other  hand  in  the  case  of  in-  10 
ferior  teachers  a  consciousness  of  their  own  defects 
not  seldom  reconciles  them  to  being  attached  to  a 
single  pupil  and  playing  the  part — for  it  amounts  to 
little  more — of  a  mere  paedagogus, 

But  let  us  assume  that  influence,  money  or  friend-  11 
ship  succeed  in  securing  a  paragon  of  learning  to 
teach  the  boy  at  home.  Will  he  be  able  to  devote 
the  whole  day  to  one  pupil  ?  Or  can  we  demand 
such  continuous  attention  on  the  part  of  the  learner  ? 
The  mind  is  as  easily  tired  as  the  eye,  if  given  no 
relaxation.  Moreover  by  far  the  larger  proportion 
of  the  learner's  time  ought  to  be  devoted  to  private 
study.  The  teacher  does  not  stand  over  him  while  12 
he  is  writing  or  thinking  or  learning  by  heart.  While 
he  is  so  occupied  the  intervention  of  anyone,  be  he 
who  he  may,  is  a  hindrance.  Further,  not  all  read- 
ing requires  to  be  first  read  aloud  or  interpreted  by 
a  master.  If  it  did,  how  would  the  boy  ever  become 
acquainted  with  all  the  authors  required  of  him  ?  A 
small  time  only  is  required  to  give  purpose  and 
direction  to  the  day's  work,  and  consequently 
individual  instruction  can  be  given  to  more  than  one 
pupil.  There  are  moreover  a  large  number  of  13 
subjects  in  which  it  is  desirable  that  instruction 
should  be  given  to  all  the  pupils  simultaneously. 
I  say  nothing  of  the  analyses  and  declamations  of

the  professors  of  rhetoric  :  in  such  cases  there  is  no 
limit  to  the  number  of  the  audience,  as  each  in- 
dividual pupil  will  in  any  case  receive  full  value. 
The  voice  of  a  lecturer  is  not  like  a  dinner  which  14 
will  only  suffice  for  a  limited  number  ;  it  is  like  the 
sun  which  distributes  the  same  quantity  of  light  and 
heat  to  all  of  us.  So  too  with  the  teacher  of 
literature.  Whether  he  speak  of  style  or  expound 
disputed  passages,  explain  stories  or  paraphrase 
poems,  everyone  who  hears  him  will  profit  by  his 
teaching.  But,  it  will  be  urged,  a  large  class  is  15 
unsuitable  for  the  correction  of  faults  or  for  explana- 
tion. It  may  be  inconvenient :  one  cannot  hope  for 
absolute  perfection  ;  but  1  shall  shortly  contrast  the 
inconvenience  with  the  obvious  advantages. 

Still  I  do  not  wish  a  boy  to  be  sent  where  he  will 
be  neglected.  But  a  good  teacher  will  not  burden 
himself  with  a  larger  number  of  pupils  than  he  can 
manage,  and  it  is  further  of  the  very  first  im- 
portance that  he  should  be  on  friendly  and  intimate 
terms  with  us  and  make  his  teaching  not  a  duty 
but  a  labour  of  love.  Then  there  will  never  be 
any  question  of  being  swamped  by  the  number  of 
our  fellow-learners.  Moreover  any  teacher  who  has  16 
the  least  tincture  of  literary  culture  will  devote 
special  attention  to  any  boy  who  shows  signs  of 
industry  and  talent;  for  such  a  pupil  will  redound 
to  his  own  credit.  But  even  if  large  schools  are  to 
be  avoided,  a  proposition  from  which  I  must  dissent 
if  the  size  be  due  to  the  excellence  of  the  teacher, 
it  does  not  follow  that  all  schools  are  to  be  avoided. 
It  is  one  thing  to  avoid  them,  another  to  select  the 
best. 

Having    refuted   these    objections,    let    me    now  17

explain  my  own  views.      It  is  above  all  things  ne-  18 
cessary  that  our  future  orator,  who  will  have  to  live 
in  the  utmost  publicity  and  in  the  broad  daylight  of 
public    life,    should    become     accustomed    from     his 
childhood    to     move    in     societv     without    fear    and 

•/ 

habituated  to  a  life  far  removed  from  that  of  the 
pale  student,  the  solitary  and  recluse.  His  mind 
requires  constant  stimulus  and  excitement,  whereas 
retirement  such  as  has  just  been  mentioned  induces 
languor  and  the  mind  becomes  mildewed  like  things 
that  are  left  in  the  dark,  or  else  flies  to  the  opposite 
extreme  and  becomes  puffed  up  with  empty  conceit ; 
for  he  who  has  no  standard  of  comparison  by  which 
to  judge  his  own  powers  will  necessarily  rate  them 
too  high.  Again  when  the  fruits  of  his  study  have  19 
to  be  displayed  to  the  public  gaze,  our  recluse  is 
blinded  by  the  sun's  glare,  and  finds  everything  new 
and  unfamiliar,  for  though  he  has  learnt  what  is  re- 
quired to  be  done  in  public,  his  learning  is  but  the 
theory  of  a  hermit.  I  say  nothing  of  friendships  20 
which  endure  unbroken  to  old  age  having  acquired 
the  binding  force  of  a  sacred  duty  :  for  initiation 
in  the  same  studies  has  all  the  sanctity  of  initiation 
in  the  same  mysteries  of  religion.  And  where  shall 
he  acquire  that  instinct  which  we  call  common 
feeling,  if  he  secludes  himself  from  that  intercourse

which  is  natural  not  merely  to  mankind  but  even  to 
dumb  animals?  Further,  at  home  he  can  only  learn  21 
what  is  taught  to  himself,  while  at  school  he  will 
learn  what  is  taught  others  as  well.  He  will  hear 
many  merits  praised  and  many  faults  corrected  every 
day  :  he  will  derive  equal  profit  from  hearing  the 
indolence  of  a  comrade  rebuked  or  his  industry 
commended.  Such  praise  will  incite  him  to  emu-  22

lation,  he  will  think  it  a  disgrace  to  be  outdone  by 
his  contemporaries  and  a  distinction  to  surpass  his 
seniors.  All  such  incentives  provide  a  valuable 
stimulus,  and  though  ambition  may  be  a  fault  in 
itself,  it  is  often  the  mother  of  virtues.  I  remember  23 
that  my  own  masters  had  a  practice  which  was  not 
without  advantages.  Having  distributed  the  boys 
in  classes,  they  made  the  order  in  which  they  were 
to  speak  depend  on  their  ability,  so  that  the  boy 
who  had  made  most  progress  in  his  studies  had  the 
privilege  of  declaiming  first.  The  performances  24 
on  these  occasions  wrere  criticised.  To  win  com- 
mendation was  a  tremendous  honour,  but  the  prize 
most  eagerly  coveted  was  to  be  the  leader  of  the 
class.  Such  a  position  was  not  permanent.  Once  a 
month  the  defeated  competitors  were  given  a  fresh 
opportunity  of  competing  for  the  prize.  Conse- 
quently success  did  not  lead  the  victor  to  relax  his 
efforts,  while  the  vexation  caused  by  defeat  served 
as  an  incentive  to  wipe  out  the  disgrace.  I  will  25 
venture  to  assert  that  to  the  best  of  my  memory 
this  practice  did  more  to  kindle  our  oratorical  am- 
bitions than  all  the  exhortations  of  our  instructors, 
the  watchfulness  of  our  paedagogi  and  the  prayers  of 
our  parents.  Further  while  emulation  promotes  26 
progress  in  the  more  advanced  pupils,  beginners  who 
are  still  of  tender  years  derive  greater  pleasure  from 
imitating  their  comrades  than  their  masters,  just 
because  it  is  easier.  For  children  still  in  the  ele- 
mentary stages  of  education  can  scarce  dare  hope  to 
reach  that  complete  eloquence  which  they  under- 
stand to  be  their  o;oal  :  their  ambition  will  not  soar

so  high,  but  they  will  imitate  the  vine  which  has  to

trained  before  it  can  reach  the  topmost  boughs.  So  27 
true  is  this  that  it  is  the  master's  duty  as  well,  if  he 
is  engaged  on  the  task  of  training  unformed  minds 
and  prefers  practical  utility  to  a  more  ambitious 
programme,  not  to  burden  his  pupils  at  once  with 
tasks  to  which  their  strength  is  unequal,  but  to  curb 
his  energies  and  refrain  from  talking  over  the  heads 
of  his  audience.  Vessels  with  narrow  mouths  will  28 
not  receive  liquids  if  too  much  be  poured  into  them 
at  a  time,  but  are  easily  filled  if  the  liquid  is  ad- 
mitted in  a  gentle  stream  or,  it  may  be,  drop  by 
drop ;  similarly  you  must  consider  how  much  a 
child's  mind  is  capable  of  receiving  :  the  things 
which  are  beyond  their  grasp  will  not  enter  their 
minds,  which  have  not  opened  out  sufficiently  to 
take  them  in.  It  is  a  good  thing  therefore  that  a  29 
boy  should  have  companions  whom  he  will  desire 
first  to  imitate  and  then  to  surpass  :  thus  he  will  be 
led  to  aspire  to  higher  achievement.  I  would  add 
that  the  instructors  themselves  cannot  develop  the 
same  intelligence  and  energy  before  a  single  listener 
as  they  can  when  inspired  by  the  presence  of  a 
numerous  audience. 

For  eloquence  depends  in  the  main  on  the  state  30 
of  the  mind,  which  must  be  moved,  conceive  images 
and  adapt  itself  to  suit  the  nature  of  the  subject 
which  is  the  theme  of  speech.  Further  the  loftier 
and  the  more  elevated  the  mind,  the  more  powerful 
will  be  the  forces  which  move  it :  consequently 
praise  gives  it  growth  and  effort  increase,  and  the 
thought  that  it  is  doing  something  great  fills  it  with 
joy.  The  duty  of  stooping  to  expend  that  power  of  31 
speaking  which  has  been  acquired  at  the  cost  of  such 
effort  upon  an  audience  of  one  gives  rise  to  a  silent

feeling  of  disdain,  and  the  teacher  is  ashamed  to 
raise  his  voice  above  the  ordinary  conversational 
level.  Imagine  the  air  of  a  declaimer,  or  the  voice 
of  an  orator,  his  gait,  his  delivery,  the  movements  of 
his  body,  the  emotions  of  his  mind,  and,  to  go  no 
further,  the  fatigue  of  his  exertions,  all  for  the  sake 
of  one  listener  !  Would  he  not  seem  little  less  than 
a  lunatic?  No,  there  would  be  no  such  thing  as 
eloquence,  if  we  spoke  only  with  one  person  at 
a  time. 

III.  The  skilful  teacher  will  make  it  his  first  care, 
as  soon  as  a  boy  is  entrusted  to  him,  to  ascertain  his 
ability  and  character.  The  surest  indication  in 
a  child  is  his  power  of  memory.  The  character- 
istics of  a  good  memory  are  twofold  :  it  must  be 
quick  to  take  in  and  faithful  to  retain  impressions 
of  what  it  receives.  The  indication  of  next  im- 
portance is  the  power  of  imitation  :  for  this  is  a 
sign  that  the  child  is  teachable  :  but  he  must  imitate 

o 

merely  what  he  is  taught,  and  must  not,  for 
example,  mimic  someone's  gait  or  bearing  or  de- 
fects. For  I  have  no  hope  that  a  child  will  turn 
out  well  who  loves  imitation  merely  for  the  purpose 
of  raising  a  laugh.  He  who  is  really  gifted  will  also 
above  all  else  be  good.  For  the  rest,  I  regard 
slowness  of  intellect  as  preferable  to  actual  bad- 
ness. But  a  good  boy  will  be  quite  unlike  the 
dullard  and  the  sloth.  My  ideal  pupil  will  absorb 
instruction  with  ease  and  will  even  ask  some 
questions  ;  but  he  will  follow  rather  than  anticipate 
his  teacher.  Precocious  intellects  rarely  produce 
sound  fruit.  By  the  precocious  I  mean  those  who 
perform  small  tasks  with  ease  and,  thus  emboldened, 
proceed  to  display  all  their  little  accomplishments

without  being  asked  :  but  their  accomplishments  are 
only  of  the  most  obvious  kind  :  they  string  words  to- 
gether and  trot  them  out  boldly  and  undeterred  by 
the  slightest  sense  of  modesty.  Their  actual  achieve- 
ment is  small,  but  what  they  can  do  they  perform  with 
ease.  They  have  no  real  power  and  what  they  have  5 
is  but  of  shallow  growth :  it  is  as  when  we  cast 
seed  on  the  surface  of  the  soil :  it  springs  up  too 
rapidly,  the  blade  apes  the  loaded  ear,  and  yellows 
ere  harvest  time,  but  bears  no  grain.  Such  tricks 
please  us  when  we  contrast  them  with  the  per- 
former's age,  but  progress  soon  stops  and  our  ad- 
miration withers  away. 

Such  indications  once  noted,  the  teacher  must  next  6 
consider  what  treatment  is  to  be  applied  to  the  mind 
of  his  pupil.  There  are  some  boys  who  are  slack, 
unless  pressed  on ;  others  again  are  impatient  of 
control :  some  are  amenable  to  fear,  while  others  are 
paralysed  by  it  :  in  some  cases  the  mind  requires 
continued  application  to  form  it,  in  others  this  result 
is  best  obtained  by  rapid  concentration.  Give  me 
the  boy  who  is  spurred  on  by  praise,  delighted  by 
success  and  ready  to  weep  over  failure.  Such  an  7 
one  must  be  encouraged  by  appeals  to  his  ambition  ; 
rebuke  will  bite  him  to  the  quick  ;  honour  will  be  a 
spur,  and  there  is  no  fear  of  his  proving  indolent. 

Still,  all  our  pupils  will  require  some  relaxation,  8 
not  merely  because  there  is  nothing  in  this  world 
that  can  stand  continued  strain  and  even  unthinking 
and  inanimate  objects  are  unable  to  maintain  their 
strength,  unless  given  intervals  of  rest,  but  because 
study  depends  on  the  good  will  of  the  student,  a 
quality  that  cannot  be  secured  by  compulsion.

they  will  bring  greater  energy  to  their  learning  and 
approach  their  work  with  greater  spirit  of  a  kind 
that  will  not  submit  to  be  driven.  1  approve  of  play  10 
in  the  young  ;  it  is  a  sign  of  a  lively  disposition  ;  nor 
will  you  ever  lead  me  to  believe  that  a  boy  who  is 
gloomy  and  in  a  continual  state  of  depression  is  ever 
likely  to  show  alertness  of  mind  in  his  work,  lacking 
as  he  does  the  impulse  most  natural  to  boys  of  his 
age.  Such  relaxation  must  not  however  be  un-  1 1 
limited :  otherwise  the  refusal  to  give  a  holiday  will 
make  boys  hate  their  work,  while  excessive  indul- 
gence will  accustom  them  to  idleness.  There  are 
moreover  certain  games  which  have  an  educational 
value  for  boys,  as  for  instance  when  they  compete 
in  posing  each  other  with  all  kinds  of  questions 
which  they  ask  turn  and  turn  about.  Games  12 
too  reveal  character  in  the  most  natural  way,  at 
least  that  is  so  if  the  teacher  will  bear  in  mind 
that  there  is  no  child  so  young  as  to  be  unable  to 
learn  to  distinguish  between  right  and  wrong,  and 
that  the  character  is  best  moulded,  when  it  is  still 
guiltless  of  deceit  and  most  susceptible  to  instruc- 
tion :  for  once  a  bad  habit  has  become  engrained, 
it  is  easier  to  break  than  bend.  There  must  be  no  13 
delay,  then,  in  warning  a  boy  that  his  actions  must 
be  unselfish,  honest,  self-controlled,  and  we  must 
never  forget  the  words  of  Virgil,

any  case  an  insult,  as  you  will  realise  if  you  imagine 
its  infliction  at  a  later  age.  Secondly  if  a  boy  is  so 
insensible  to  instruction  that  reproof  is  useless,  he 
will,  like  the  worst  type  of  slave,  merely  become 
hardened  to  blows.  Finally  there  will  be  absolutely  no 
need  of  such  punishment  if  the  master  is  a  thorough 
disciplinarian.  As  it  is,  we  try  to  make  amends  for  If> 
the  negligence  of  the  boy's  paedagogus,  not  by 
forcing  him  to  do  what  is  right,  but  by  punishing 
him  for  not  doing  what  is  right.  And  though  you 
may  compel  a  child  with  blows,  what  are  you 
to  do  with  him  when  he  is  a  young  man  no  longer 
amenable  to  such  threats  and  confronted  with  tasks 
of  far  greater  difficulty?  Moreover  when  children  iG 
are  beaten,  pain  or  fear  frequently  have  results  of 
which  it  is  not  pleasant  to  speak  and  which  are 
likely  subsequently  to  be  a  source  of  shame,  a  shame 
which  unnerves  and  depresses  the  mind  and  leads 
the  child  to  shun  and  loathe  the  light.  Further  if  in-  17 
adequate  care  is  taken  in  the  choices  of  respectable 
governors  and  instructors,  I  blush  to  mention  the 
shameful  abuse  which  scoundrels  sometimes  make 
of  their  right  to  administer  corporal  punishment  or 
the  opportunity  not  infrequently  offered  to  others 
by  the  fear  thus  caused  in  the  victims.  I  will  not 
linger  on  this  subject ;  it  is  more  than  enough  if  I 
have  made  my  meaning  clear.  I  will  content  myself 
with  saying  that  children  are  helpless  and  easily 
victimised,  and  that  therefore  no  one  should  be  given 
unlimited  power  over  them.  I  will  now  proceed  to  18 
describe  the  subjects  in  which  the  boy  must  be 
trained,  if  he  is  to  become  an  orator,  and  to  indicate 
the  age  at  which  each  should  be  commenced.

write  without  difficulty,  it  is  the  turn  for  the  teacher1 
of  literature.  My  words  apply  equally  to  Greek  and 
Latin  masters,  though  I  prefer  that  a  start  should 
be  made  with  a  Greek  :  in  either  case  the  method  2 
is  the  same.  This  profession  may  be  most  briefly 
considered  under  two  heads,  the  art  of  speaking 
correctly  and  the  interpretation  of  the  poets  ;  but 
there  is  more  beneath  the  surface  than  meets  the 
eye.  For  the  art  of  writing  is  combined  with  that  of  3 
speaking,  and  correct  reading  precedes  interpre- 
tation, while  in  each  of  these  cases  criticism  has  its 
work  to  perform.  The  old  school  of  teachers  indeed 
carried  their  criticism  so  far  that  they  were  not 
content  with  obelising  lines  or  rejecting  books  whose 
titles  they  regarded  as  spurious,  as  though  they 
were  expelling  a  supposititious  child  from  the  family 
circle,  but  also  drew  up  a  canon  of  authors,  from 
which  some  were  omitted  altogether.  Nor  is  it  4 
sufficient  to  have  read  the  poets  only ;  every  kind  of 
writer  must  be  carefully  studied,  not  merely  for  the 
subject  matter,  but  for  the  vocabulary  ;  for  words 
often  acquire  authority  from  their  use  by  a  particular 
author.  Nor  can  such  training  be  regarded  as  com- 
plete if  it  stop  short  of  music,  for  the  teacher  of 
literature  has  to  speak  of  metre  and  rhythm  :  nor 
again  if  he  be  ignorant  of  astronomy,  can  he  under- 
stand the  poets ;  for  they, to  mention  no  further  points, 
frequently  give  their  indications  of  time  by  reference 
to  the  rising  and  setting  of  the  stars.  Ignorance  of 

o  o  o 

philosophy  is  an  equal  drawback,  since  there  are 
numerous  passages  in  almost  every  poem  based  on 
the  most  intricate  questions  of  natural  philosophy, 
while  among  the  Greeks  we  have  Empedocles  and 
among  our  own  poets  Varro  and  Lucretius,  all  of

whom  have  expounded  their  philosophies  in  verse. 
No  small  powers  of  eloquence  also  are  required  to  5 
enable  the  teacher  to  speak  appropriately  and 
fluently  on  the  various  points  which  have  just  been 
mentioned.  For  this  reason  those  who  criticise  the 
art  of  teaching  literature  as  trivial  and  lacking  in 
substance  put  themselves  out  of  court.  Unless  the 
foundations  of  oratory  are  well  and  truly  laid  by 
the  teaching  of  literature,  the  superstructure  will 
collapse.  The  study  of  literature  is  a  necessity  for 
boys  and  the  delight  of  old  age,  the  sweet  com- 
panion of  our  privacy  and  the  sole  branch  of  study 
which  has  more  solid  substance  than  display. 

The  elementary  stages  of  the  teaching  of  litera-  6 
ture  must  not  therefore  be  despised  as  trivial.  It  is 
of  course  an  easy  task  to  point  out  the  difference 
between  vowels  and  consonants,  and  to  subdivide  the 
latter  into  semivowels  and  mutes.  But  as  the  pupil 
gradually  approaches  the  inner  shrine  of  the  sacred 
place,  he  will  come  to  realise  the  intricacy  of  the  sub- 
ject, an  intricacy  calculated  not  merely  to  sharpen  the 
wits  of  a  boy,  but  to  exercise  even  the  most  profound 
knowledge  and  erudition.  It  is  not  every  ear  that  7 
can  appreciate  the  correct  sound  of  the  different 
letters.  It  is  fully  as  hard  as  to  distinguish  the 
different  notes  in  music.  But  all  teachers  of  litera- 
ture will  condescend  to  such  minutiae  :  they 
will  discuss  for  instance  whether  certain  necessary 
letters  are  absent  from  the  alphabet,  not  indeed 
when  we  are  writing  Greek  words  (for  then  we 
borrow  two  letters  l  from  them),  but  in  the  case  of 
genuine  Latin  words  :  for  example  in  words  such  as  8 
seruus  and  uidgus  we  feel  the  lack  of  the  Aeolic 
digamma  ;  there  is  also  a  sound  intermediate  between

u  and  i}  for  we  do  not  pronounce  optimum  as  we  do  opi- 
mum,  while  in  here  the  sound  is  neither  exactly  e  or  i. 
Again  there  is  the  question  whether  certain  letters  9 
are  not  superfluous,  not  to  mention  the  mark  of  the 
aspirate,  to  which,  if  it  is  required  at  all,  there 
should  be  a  corresponding  symbol  to  indicate  the 
opposite  :  for  instance  /-,  which  is  also  used  as  an 
abbreviation  for  certain  nouns,  and  q,  which,  though 
slanted  slightly  more  by  us,  resembles  both  in  sound 
and  shape  the  Greek  koppa,  now  used  by  the  Greeks 
solely  as  a  numerical  sign  1 :  there  is  also  x,  the  last 
letter  of  our  own  alphabet,  which  we  could  dispense 
with  as  easily  as  with  psi.  Again  the  teacher  of  10 
literature  will  have  to  determine  whether  certain 
vowels  have  not  been  consonantalised.  For  instance 
iam  and  etiam  are  both  spelt  with  an  i,  uos  and  tuos 
both  with  a  u.  Vowels,  however,  when  joined  as 
vowels,  either  make  one  long  vowel  (compare  the 
obsolete  method  of  indicating  a  long  vowel  by 
doubling  it  as  the  equivalent  of  the  circumflex), 
or  a  diphthong,  though  some  hold  that  even  three 
vowels  can  form  a  single  syllable  ;  this  however  is 
only  possible  if  one  or  more  assume  the  role  of 
consonants.  He  will  also  inquire  why  it  is  that  11 
there  are  two  vowels  which  may  be  repeated,  while 
a  consonant  can  only  be  followed  and  modified  by 
a  different  consonant.2  But  z  can  follow  i  (for 
coniicit  is  derived  from  tacit 3)  :  so  too  does  u,  wit- 
ness the  modern  spelling  of  seruus  and  uulgus.  He 
should  also  know  that  Cicero  preferred  to  write 
aiio  and  Maiiam  with  a  double  z ;  in  that  case  one 

2  The  two  vowels  are  i  and   u.     A  consonant  cannot  be 
duplicated  within  one  syllable. 

3  The  derivation  is  mentioned  to  show  that  two  z's,  not 
one,  are  found  in  the  second  syllable  of  coniicit.

of  them  is  consonantalised.  A  boy  therefore  must  12 
learn  both  the  peculiarities  and  the  common  charac- 
teristics of  letters  and  must  know  how  they  are 
related  to  each  other.  Nor  must  he  be  surprised 
that  scabillum  is  formed  from  scamnus  or  that  a 
double-edged  axe  should  be  called  bipen?iis  from 
pinrius,  "  sharp"  :  for  I  would  not  have  him  fall  into 
the  same  error  as  those  who,  supposing  this  word  to 
be  derived  from  bis  and  pennae,  think  that  it  is  a 
metaphor  from  the  wings  of  birds. 

He  must  not  be  content  with  knowing  only  those  13 
changes  introduced  by  conjugation  and  prefixes, 
such  as  secat  secuit,  cadit  excldit,  caedit  excidit,  calcat 
exculcat,  to  which  might  be  added  lotus  from  lauare 
and  again  inlotus  with  a  thousand  others.  He  must 
learn  as  well  the  changes  that  time  has  brought 
about  even  in  nominatives.  For  just  as  names  like 
Valesius  and  Fusius  have  become  Valerius  and  Furius, 
so  arbos,  labos,  vapos  and  even  clamos  and  lases l 
were  the  original  forms.  And  this  same  letter  s,  14 
which  has  disappeared  from  these  words,  has  itself 
in  some  cases  taken  the  place  of  another  letter.  For 
our  ancestors  used  to  say  mertare  and  puttare.*  They 
also  said  fordeum  and  faedi,  using  f  instead  of  the 
aspirate  as  being  a  kindred  letter.  For  the  Greeks 
unlike  us  aspirate  f  like  their  own  phi,  as  Cicero 
bears  witness  in  the  pro  Fundanio,  where  he  laughs  at 
a  witness  who  is  unable  to  pronounce  the  first  letter 
of  that  name.  In  some  cases  again  we  have  substi-  15 
tuted  b  for  other  letters,  as  with  Burrus,  Bruges, 
and  Belena.3  The  same  letter  too  has  turned  duellum 
into  helium,  and  as  a  result  some  have  ventured  to 
call  the  Duelii  Belli.  What  of  stlocus  and  stliies*  16

which  makes  it  less  surprising  that  on  some  of 
the  older  buildings  of  Rome  and  certain  famous 
temples  \ve  should  find  the  names  Alexanier  and 
Cassantra  ?  What  again  of  the  interchange  of  o 
and  u,  of  which  examples  may  be  found  in  Hecoba, 
notrix,  Culcides  and  Pulixena,  or  to  take  purely  Latin 
words  dederont  and  probaueront  ?  So  too  Odysseus, 
which  the  Aeolian  dialect  turned  into  Ulysseus,  has 
been  transformed  by  us  into  Ulixes.  Similarly  e  in  17 
certain  cases  held  the  place  that  is  now  occupied 
by  i,  as  in  Menerua,  leber,  magester,  and  Dioue  victore 
in  place  of  Dioui  viclori.  It  is  sufficient  for  me  to 
give  a  mere  indication  as  regards  these  points,  for  I 
am  not  teaching,  but  merely  advising  those  who 
have  got  to  teach.  The  next  subject  to  which  atten- 
tion must  be  given  is  that  of  syllables,  of  which  I  will 
speak  briefly,  when  I  come  to  deal  with  orthography. 
Following  this  the  teacher  concerned  will  note 
the  number  and  nature  of  the  parts  of  speech, 
although  there  is  some  dispute  as  to  their  number. 
Earlier  writers,  among  them  Aristotle  himself  and  18 
Theodectes,  hold  that  there  are  but  three,  verbs, 
nouns  and  convinctions.  Their  view  was  that  the 
force  of  language  resided  in  the  verbs,  and  the 
matter  in  the  nouns  (for  the  one  is  what  we  speak, 
the  other  that  which  we  speak  about),  while  the 
duty  of  the  convinctions  was  to  provide  a  link 
between  the  nouns  and  the  verbs.  I  know  that 
conjunction  is  the  term  in  general  use.  But  convinclion 
seems  to  me  to  be  the  more  accurate  translation  of 
the  Greek  o-wSecr/xoV  Gradually  the  number  was  19 
increased  by  the  philosophers,  more  especially  by 
the  Stoics  :  articles  were  first  added  to  the  convinc- 
tions, then  prepositions :  to  nouns  appellations  were

added,  then  the  pronoun  and  finally  the  participle, 
which  holds  a  middle  position  between  the  verb 
and  the  noun.  To  the  verb  itself  was  added  the 
adverb.  Our  own  language  dispenses  with  the 
articles,  which  are  therefore  distributed  among  the 

'  O 

other  parts  of  speech.  But  interjections  must  be  20 
added  to  those  already  mentioned.  Others  how- 
ever follow  good  authority  in  asserting  that  there 
are  eight  parts  of  speech.  Among  these  I  may 
mention  Aristarchus  and  in  our  own  day  Palaemon, 
who  classified  the  vocable  or  appellation  as  a  species 
of  the  genus  noun.  Those  on  the  other  hand  who 
distinguish  between  the  noun  and  the  vocable,  make 
nine  parts  of  speech.  But  yet  again  there  are 
some  who  differentiate  between  the  vocable  and  the 
appellation,  saying  that  the  vocable  indicates  concrete 
objects  which  can  be  seen  and  touched,  such  as  a 
"  house  "  or  "  bed,"  while  an  appellation  is  something 
imperceptible  either  to  sight  or  touch  or  to  both, 
such  as  the  "wind/'  "heaven,"  or  "virtue."  They 
added  also  the  asseveration,  such  as  "alas'  and  the 
derivative1  such  asfasdatim.  But  of  these  classifica- 
tions I  do  not  approve.  Whether  we  should  trans-  21 
late  -rrpocrriyopia.  by  vocable  or  appellation,  and  whether 
it  should  be  regarded  as  a  species  of  noun,  I  leave 
to  the  decision  of  such  as  desire  to  express  their 
opinion  :  it  is  a  matter  of  no  importance.

and  conjugate  verbs  :  otherwise  they  will  never  be 
able  to  understand  the  next  subject  of  study.  This 
admonition  would  be  superfluous  but  for  the  fact 
that  most  teachers,  misled  by  a  desire  to  show  rapid 
progress,  begin  with  what  should  really  come  at  the 
end:  their  passion  for  displaying  their  pupils'  talents

in  connexion  with  the  more  imposing  aspects  of 
their  work  serves  but  to  delay  progress  and  their 
short  cut  to  knowledge  merely  lengthens  the 
journey.  And  yet  a  teacher  who  has  acquired  23 
sufficient  knowledge  himself  and  is  ready  to  teach 
what  he  has  learned — and  such  readiness  is  all  too 
rare — will  not  be  content  with  stating  that  nouns 
have  three  genders  or  with  mentioning  those  which 
are  common  to  two  or  all  three  together.  Nor  24 
again  shall  I  be  in  a  hurry  to  regard  it  as  a  proof  of 
real  diligence,,  if  he  points  out  that  there  are  irregu- 
lar nouns  of  the  kind  called  epicene  by  the  Greeks, 
in  which  one  gender  implies  both,  or  which  in  spite 
of  being  feminine  or  neuter  in  form  indicate  males 
or  females  respectively,  as  for  instance  Muraena 
and  Glycerium  A  really  keen  and  intelligent  teacher  25 
will  inquire  into  the  origin  of  names  derived  from 
physical  characteristics,  such  as  Kufns  or  Longus, 
whenever  their  meaning  is  obscure,  as  in  the  case  of 
8ulla,  Burrus,  Galba,  Plautus,  Pansa,  Scaurus  and  the 
like  ;  of  names  derived  from  accidents  of  birth  such 
as  Agrippa,  Opiter,  Cordus  and  Postumus,  and  again  of 
names  given  after  birth  such  as  Vopiscus.  Then  there 
are  names  such  as  Cotta,  Scipio,  Laenas  or  Seranus,1 
which  originated  in  various  ways.  It  will  also  be  found  26 

^7  J 

that  names  are  frequently  derived  from  races,  places 
and  many  other  causes.  Further  there  are  obsolete 
slave-names  such  as  Marcipor  or  Publipor*  derived 
from  the  names  of  their  owners.  The  teacher  must 
also  inquire  whether  there  is  not  room  for  a  sixth 

after  the  premature  birth  and  death  of  the  other.  Scipio  = 
staff.  Laenas  from  laena  (cloak).  Seranus  =  the  sower.

case  in  Greek  and  a  seventh  in  Latin.  For  when  I 
say  "wounded  by  a  spear/'  the  case  is  not  a  true 
ablative  in  Latin  nor  a  true  dative  in  Greek.  Again  27 
if  we  turn  to  verbs,  who  is  so  ill-educated  as  not  to 
be  familiar  with  their  various  kinds  and  qualities, 
their  different  persons  and  numbers.  Such  sub- 
jects belong  to  the  elementary  school  and  the 
rudiments  of  knowledge.  Some,  however,  will 
find  points  undetermined  by  inflexion  somewhat 
perplexing.  For  there  are  certain  participles,  about 
which  there  may  be  doubts  as  to  whether  they  are 
really  nouns  or  verbs,  since  their  meaning  varies 
with  their  use,  as  for  example  lectum  and  sapiens, 
while  there  are  other  verbs  which  resemble  nouns,  28 
such  Rsjraifdalor  and  nutritor.1  Again  itur  in  antiqitam 
silvam2  is  a  peculiar  usage.  For  there  is  no  subject 
to  serve  as  a  starting  point :  fletur  is  a  similar  example. 
The  passive  may  be  used  in  different  ways  as  for 
instance  in 

panditur  interea  domus  omnipote?itis  Olympi 3 
and  in 

'toils  usque  adeo  turbatur  agris.* 

Yet  a  third  usage  is  found  in  urbs  habitatur,  whence 
we  get  phrases  such  as  campus  curritur  and  mare  navi- 
gatur.  Pransus  and  potus5  have  a  meaning  which  does  29 
not  correspond  to  their  form.  And  what  of  those 
verbs  which  are  only  partially  conjugated?  Some 
(as  for  instance  fero)  even  suffer  an  entire  change  in 
the  perfect.  Others  are  used  only  in  the  third

V.  Style  has  three  kinds  of  excellence,  correct- 
ness, lucidity  and  elegance  (for  many  include  the 
all-important  quality  of  appropriateness  under  the 
heading  of  elegance).  Its  faults  are  likewise  three- 
fold, namely  the  opposites  of  these  excellences.  The 
teacher  of  literature  therefore  must  study  the  rules 
for  correctness  of  speech,  these  constituting  the 
first  part  of  his  art.  The  observance  of  these  rules  2 
is  concerned  with  either  one  or  more  words.  I  must 
now  be  understood  to  use  verbinn  in  its  most  general 
sense.  It  has  of  course  two  meanings  ;  the  one  covers 
all  the  parts  of  which  language  is  composed,  as  in 
the  line  of  Horace  : 

"Once  supply  the  thought, 

And  words  will  follow  swift  as  soon  as  sought '  ;2 

o 

the  other  restricts  it  to  a  part  of  speech  such  as 
lego  and  scribo.  To  avoid  this  ambiguity,  some 
authorities  prefer  the  terms  voces,  locutiojies,  dictiones. 
Individual  words  will  either  be  native  or  imported,  3 
simple  or  compound,  literal  or  metaphorical,  in 
current  use  or  newly-coined. 

A  single  word  is  more  likely  to  be  faulty  than 
to  possess  any  intrinsic  merit.  For  though  we 
may  speak  of  a  word  as  appropriate,  distinguished 
or  sublime,  it  can  possess  none  of  these  properties 
save  in  relation  to  connected  and  consecutive  speech  ; 
since  when  we  praise  words,  we  do  so  because  they 
suit  the  matter.  There  is  only  one  excellence  that  4

can  be  isolated  for  consideration,  namely  euphony, 
the  Greek  term  for  our  uocalitas  :  that  is  to  say  that, 
when  we  are  confronted  with  making  a  choice 
between  two  exact  synonyms,  we  must  select  that 
which  sounds  best. 

In  the  first  place  barbarisms  and  solecisms  must  not  6 
be  allowed  to  intrude  their  offensive  presence.  These 
blemishes  are  however  pardoned  at  times,  because 
we  have  become  accustomed  to  them  or  because  they 
have  age  or  authority  in  their  favour  or  are  near  akin 
to  positive  excellences,  since  it  is  often  difficult  to  dis- 
tinguish such  blemishes  from  figures  of  speech.1  The 
teacher  therefore,  that  such  slippery  customers  may 
not  elude  detection,  must  seek  to  acquire  a  delicate 
discrimination;  but  of  this  I  will  speak  later  when 
I  come  to  discuss  figures  of  speech.  For  the  present  6 
I  will  define  barbaris?n  as  an  offence  occurring  in 
connexion  with  single  words.  Some  of  my  readers 
may  object  that  such  a  topic  is  beneath  the  dignity 
of  so  ambitious  a  work.  But  who  does  not  know 
that  some  barbarisms  occur  in  writing,  others  in 
speaking  ?  For  although  what  is  incorrect  in 
writing  will  also  be  incorrect  in  speech,  the  converse 
is  not  necessarily  true,  inasmuch  as  mistakes  in 

*• 

writing  are  caused  by  addition  or  omission,  substitu-

due  to  separation  or  combination  of  syllables,  to 
aspiration  or  other  errors  of  sound.  Trivial  as  these  7

more  learned  teacher  on  the  other  hand  will  be  in  a 
position  to  go  much  further :  first  of  all,  for  example, 
he  will  point  out  that  there  are  many  different  kinds 
of  barbarism.  One  kind  is  due  to  race,  such  as  the  8 
insertion  of  a  Spanish  or  African  term  ;  for  instance 
the  iron  tire  of  a  wheel  is  called  cantus,1  though 
Persius  uses  it  as  established  in  the  Latin  language  ; 

^j          ^>        * 

Catullus  picked  up  ploxenum2  (a  box)  in  the  valley 
of  the  Po,  while  the  author  of  the  in  Pollionem,  be 
he  Labienus  or  Cornelius  Gallus,  imported  casamo 
from  Gaul  in  the  sense  of  "follower."  As  for 
mastruca?  which  is  Sardinian  fora  "rough  coat,"  it 
is  introduced  by  Cicero  merely  as  an  object  of  deri- 
sion. Another  kind  of  barbarism  proceeds  from  the  9 
speaker's  temper  :  for  instance,  we  regard  it  as  bar- 
barous if  a  speaker  use  cruel  or  brutal  language. 
A  third  and  very  common  kind,  of  which  anyone  10 
may  fashion  examples  for  himself,  consists  in  the 
addition  or  omission  of  a  letter  or  syllable,  or  in  the 
substitution  of  one  for  another  or  in  placing  one 
where  it  has  no  right  to  be.  Some  teachers  however,  11 
to  display  their  learning,  are  in  the  habit  of  picking 
out  examples  of  barbarism  from  the  poets  and  attack- 
ing the  authors  whom  they  are  expounding  for 
using  such  words.  A  boy  should  however  realize 
that  in  poets  such  peculiarities  are  pardonable  or 
even  praiseworthy,  and  should  therefore  be  taught 
less  common  instances.  For  Tinga  of  Placentia,  if  12 
we  may  believe  Hortensius  who  takes  him  to  task  for 
it,  committed  two  barbarisms  in  one  word  by  saying 
precula  for  pergula :  that  is  to  say  he  substituted  c 
for  g,  and  transposed  r  and  e.  On  the  other  hand

BOOK    I.  v.  12-16 

when  Ennius  writes  Mettoeoque  Fufetioeo,1  where 
the  barbarism  is  twice  repeated,,  he  is  defended  on 
the  plea  of  poetic  licence.  Substitution  is  however  1H 
sometimes  admitted  even  in  prose,  as  for  instance 
when  Cicero  speaks  of  the  army  of  Canopus  which  is 
locally  styled  Canobus,  while  the  number  of  authors 
who  have  been  guilty  of  transposition  in  writing 
Trasumennus  for  Tarsumcnmis  has  succeeded  in  stan- 
dardising the  error.  Similar  instances  may  be  quoted. 
If  adsentior  be  regarded  as  the  correct  form,  we  must 
remember  that  Sisenna  said  adsentio,  and  that  many 
have  followed  him  on  the  ground  of  analogy :  on 
the  other  hand,  if  adsentio  is  the  correct  form,  we 
must  remember  that  adsentior  has  the  support  of 
current  usage.  And  yet  our  fat  fool,  the  fashionable  14 
schoolmaster,  will  regard  one  of  these  forms  as  an 
example  of  omission  or  the  other  as  an  instance 
of  addition.  Again  there  are  words  which  when 
used  separately  are  undoubtedly  incorrect,  but 
when  used  in  conjunction  excite  no  unfavourable 
comment.  For  instance  dua  and  ire  are  barbarisms  15 
and  differ  in  gender,  but  the  words  duapondo 
and  trepondo 2  have  persisted  in  common  parlance 
down  to  our  own  day,  and  Messala  shows  that  the 
practice  is  correct.  It  may  perhaps  seem  absurd  to  16 
say  that  a  barbarism,  which  is  an  error  in  a  single 
word,  may  be  made,  like  a  solecism,  by  errors  in 
connexion  with  number  or  gender.  But  take  on  the 
one  hand  scala  (stairs)  and  scopa  (which  literally 
means  a  twig,  but  is  used  in  the  sense  of  broom) 
and  on  the  other  hand  hordea  (barley)  and  mulsa 
(mead) :  here  we  have  substitution,  omission  and 
addition  of  letters,  but  the  blemish  consists  in  the 
former  case  merely  in  the  use  of  singular  for  plural,

in  the  latter  of  plural  for  singular.  Those  on  the 
other  hand  who  have  used  the  word  gladia  are  guilty 
of  a  mistake  in  gender.  I  merely  mention  these  as  17 
instances :  I  do  not  wish  anyone  to  think  that  I 
have  added  a  fresh  problem  to  a  subject  into  which 
the  obstinacy  of  pedants  has  already  introduced 
confusion. 

The  faults  which  arise  in  the  course  of  actual 
speaking  require  greater  penetration  on  the  part 
of  the  critic,  since  it  is  impossible  to  cite  examples 
from  writing,  except  in  cases  where  they  occur 
in  poetry,  as  when  the  diphthong  is  divided  into 
two  syllables  in  Europai  and  Asiai l  ;  or  when  the 
opposite  fault  occurs,  called  synaeresis  or  synaloephe 
by  the  Greeks  and  comple.no  by  ourselves  :  as  an 
example  I  may  quote  the  line  of  Publius  Varro  : 

turn  te  flagranti  deieclum  fulmine  Phaet/ion.2 

If  this  were  prose,  it  would  be  possible  to  give  1£ 
the  letters  their  true  syllabic  value.  I  may  mention 
as  further  anomalies  peculiar  to  poetry  the  lengthen- 
ing of  a  short  syllable  as  in  Italiam  fato  proj'ugus,3 
or  the  shortening  of  a  long  such  as  unius  ob  noxam 
et  furias  ; 4  but  in  poetry  we  cannot  label  these  as 
actual  faults.  Errors  in  sound  on  the  other  hand  19 
can  be  detected  by  the  ear  alone  ;  although  in  Latin, 
as  regards  the  addition  or  omission  of  the  aspirate, 
the  question  may  be  raised  whether  this  is  an  error 
when  it  occurs  in  writing  ;  for  there  is  some  doubt 
whether  A  is  a  letter  or  merely  a  breathing,  practice 
having  frequently  varied  in  different  ages.  Older  20 
authors  used  it  but  rarely  even  before  vowels,  saying 
aedus  or  irtus,  while  its  conjunction  with  consonants 
was  for  a  long  time  avoided,  as  in  words  such  as

2  The  Roman  accent  was  a  stress,  while  the  Greek  was  a 
pitch  accent,  though  by  the  Christian  era  tending  to  change 
into  stress.     Roman  grammarians  borrow  the  Greek  termin- 
ology and  speak  of  accents  in  terms  of  pitch.     The  explana- 
tion of  this  is  probably  that  the  Roman  stress  accent  was 

88

Graccus  or  triumpus.    Then  for  a  short  time  it  broke 
out  into  excessive  use,  witness  such  spelling  as  chorona, 
chenturia  or  praecho,  which  may  still  be  read  in  certain 
inscriptions  :  the  well-known  epigram  of  Catullus  l 
will  be  remembered  in  this  connexion.   The  spellings  2) 
vehementer,  comprehendere  and  mihi  have  lasted  to  our 
own   day :    and    among    early  writers,  especially  of 
tragedy, we  actually  find  mehe  for  me  in  the  older  MSS. 

It  is  still  more  difficult  to  detect  errors  of  tenor  or  22 
tone  (I  note  that  old  writers  spell  the  word  tonor, 
as  derived  from  the  Greek  roVos),  or  of  accent,  styled 
prosody  by  the  Greeks,  such  as  the  substitution  of 
the  acute  accent  for  the  grave  or  the  grave  for  the 
acute  :  such  an  example  would  be  the  placing  of  the 
acute  accent  on  the  first  syllable  of  Camillas,  or  the  23 
substitution  of  the  grave  for  the  circumflex  in  Cetkegus, 
an  error  which  results  in  the  alteration  of  the 
quantity  of  the  middle  syllable,  since  it  means 
making  the  first  syllable  acute  ;  or  again  the  sub- 

O  mt 

stitution  of  the  circumflex  for  the  grave  on  the 
second  syllable  of  Appi,  where  the  contraction  of 
two  syllables  into  one  circumflexed  syllable  involves 
a  double  error.  This,  however,  occurs  far  more  fre-  24 
quently  in  Greek  words  such  as  Atrei,  which  in  our 
young  days  was  pronounced  by  the  most  learned  of 
our  elders  with  an  acute  accent  on  the  first  syllable, 
necessitating  a  grave  accent  on  the  second  ;  the 
same  remark  applies  to  Nerei  and  Terei.  Such  has 
been  the  tradition  as  regards  accents.2 


-to 


accompanied  by  an  elevation  of  the  pitch.  Here  the  acute 
accent  certainly  implies  stress  ;  the  grave  implies  a  drop  in 
pitch  and  the  absence  of  stress.  The  circumflex  means  that 
the  voice  rises  slightly  and  then  falls  slightly,  but  implies 
stress.  See  Lindsay,  Latin  Language,  pp.  148-153.

BOOK    I.  v.  25-29 

Still  I  am  well  aware  that  certain  learned  men  25 
and  some  professed  teachers  of  literature,  to  ensure 
that  certain  words  may  be  kept  distinct,  sometimes 
place  an  acute  accent  on  the  last  syllable,  both  when 
they  are  teaching  and  in  ordinary  speech  :  as,  for 
instance,  in  the  following  passage  : 

quae  circum  litora,  circum 
piscosos  scop  ul  os,1 

where  they  make  the  last  syllable  of  circum  acute  on  26 
the  ground  that,  if  that  syllable  were  given  the  grave 
accent,  it  might  be  thought  that  they  meant  circus 
not  circuilus."  Similarly  when  quale  is  interrogative, 
they  give  the  final  syllable  a  grave  accent,  but  when 
using  it  in  a  comparison,  make  it  acute.  This  practice, 
however,  they  restrict  almost  entirely  to  adverbs 
and  pronouns  ;  in  other  cases  they  follow  the  old 
usage.  Personally  I  think  that  in  such  phrases  27 
as  these  the  circumstances  are  almost  entirely  altered 
by  the  fact  that  we  join  two  words  together.  For 
when  I  say  circum  litora  I  pronounce  the  phrase  as 
one  word,  concealing  the  fact  that  it  is  composed  of 
two,  consequently  it  contains  but  one  acute  accent, 
as  though  it  were  a  single  wrord.  The  same  thing 
occurs  in  the  phrase  Troiae  qui  primus  ab  oris?  It  28 
sometimes  happens  that  the  accent  is  altered  by 
the  metre  as  in  pecudes  pictaeque  volucres  4 ;  for  I  shall 
read  volucres  with  the  acute  on  the  middle  syllable, 
because,  although  that  syllable  is  short  by  nature,  it 
is  long  by  position  :  else  the  last  two  syllables 
would  form  an  iambus,  which  its  position  in  the 
hexameter  does  not  allow.  But  these  same  words,  29 
if  separated,  will  form  no  exception  to  the  rule  :  or

sive   ultimae,  et  in  iis  aut  proxima  extremae  aut  ab

nee     unquam    ultima    ideoque    in    dissyllabis    prior.

of  the  language  will  disappear.  (This  law  is  more 
difficult  for  the  Greeks  to  observe,  because  they 
have  several  dialects,  as  they  call  them,  and  what  is 
wrong  in  one  may  be  right  in  another.)  But  with  us 

O  mf  O  / 

the  rule  is  simplicity  itself.  For  in  every  word  30 
the  acute  accent  is  restricted  to  three  syllables, 
whether  these  be  the  only  syllables  in  the  word  or 
the  three  last,  and  will  fall  either  on  the  penultimate 
or  the  antepenultimate.  The  middle  of  the  three 
syllables  of  which  I  speak  will  be  acute  or  circum- 
flexed,  if  long,  while  if  it  be  short,  it  will  have  a 
grave  accent  and  the  acute  will  be  thrown  back  to 
the  preceding  syllable,  that  is  to  say  the  ante- 
penultimate. Every  word  has  an  acute  accent,  but  31 
never  more  than  one.  Further  the  acute  never  falls 
on  the  last  syllable  and  therefore  in  dissyllabic  words 
marks  the  first  syllable.  Moreover  the  acute  accent 
and  the  circumflex  are  never  found  in  one  and  the 
same  word,  since  the  circumflex  itself  contains  an 
acute  accent.  Neither  the  circumflex  nor  the  acute, 
therefore,  will  ever  be  found  in  the  last  syllable  of 
a  Latin  word,  with  this  exception,  that  monosyllables 
must  either  be  acute  or  circumflexed  ;  otherwise  we 
should  find  words  without  an  acute  accent  at  all. 
There  are  also  faults  of  sound,  which  we  cannot  repro-  32 
duce  in  writing,  as  they  spring  from  defects  of  the 
voice  and  tongue.  The  Greeks  who  are  happier  in 
inventing  names  than  we  are  call  them  iotacisms, 
lambdacisms,1  lo-^oT^Te?  (attenuations)  and  TrAareia- 
o7/.of  (broadenings) ;  they  also  use  the  term  KoiXoo-ro/xta, 
when  the  voice  seems  to  proceed  from  the  depths  of 
the  mouth.  There  are  also  certain  peculiar  and  33 
indescribable  sounds  for  which  we  sometimes  take 
whole  nations  to  fault.  To  sum  up  then,  if  all  the 
faults  of  which  we  have  just  spoken  be  avoided,

we  shall  be  in  possession  of  the  Greek  op 
that  is  to  say,  an  exact  and  pleasing  articulation  ;  for 
that  is  what  we  mean  when  we  speak  of  correct 
pronunciation. 

All  other  faults  in  speaking  are  concerned  with  34 
more  words  than  one  ;  among  this  class  of  faults  is 
the  solecism,  although  there  have  been  controversies 
about  this  as  well.  For  even  those  who  acknowledge 
that  it  occurs  in  connected  speech,  argue  that,  since 
it  can  be  corrected  by  the  alteration  of  one  word, 
the  fault  lies  in  the  word  and  not  in  the  phrase  or 
sentence.  For  example  whether  amarae  corticis  l  or  35 
medio  cortice2  contains  a  solecism  in  gender  (and 
personally  I  object  to  neither,  as  Vergil  is  the 
author  of  both  ;  however,  for  the  sake  of  argument 
let  us  assume  that  one  of  the  two  is  incorrect),  still 
whichever  phrase  is  incorrect,  it  can  be  set  right  by 
the  alteration  of  the  word  in  which  the  fault  lies : 
that  is  to  say  we  can  emend  either  to  amari  corticis 
or  media  cortice.  But  it  is  obvious  that  these  critics 
misrepresent  the  case.  For  neither  word  is  faulty 
in  itself ;  the  error  arises  from  its  association  with 
another  word.  The  fault  therefore  lies  in  the 
phrase.  Those  who  raise  the  question  as  to  whether  36 
a  solecism  can  arise  in  a  single  word  show  greater 
intelligence.  Is  it  for  instance  a  solecism  if  a  man 

O 

when  calling  a  single  person  to  him  says  uenite, 
or  in  dismissing  several  persons  says  obi  or  discede  ? 
Or  again  if  the  answer  does  not  correspond  to  the 
question  :  suppose,  for  example,  when  someone  said 
to  you  "  Whom  do  I  see  ?  ",  you  were  to  reply  "  I." 
Some  too  think  it  a  solecism  if  the  spoken  word  is 
contradicted  by  the  motion  of  hand  or  head.  I  do  37 
not  entirely  concur  with  this  view  nor  yet  do  I

in  a  single  word,  but  with  this  proviso  :  there  must 
be  something  else  equivalent  to  another  word,  to 
which  the  word,  in  which  the  error  lies,  can  be 
referred,  so  that  the  solecism  arises  from  the  faulty 
connexion  of  those  symbols  by  which  facts  are  ex- 
pressed and  purpose  indicated.  To  avoid  all  sus-  3S 
picion  of  quibbling,  I  will  say  that  a  solecism  may 
occur  in  one  word,  but  never  in  a  word  in  isolation. 
There  is,  however,  some  controversy  as  to  the 
number  and  nature  of  the  different  kinds  of  solecism. 
Those  who  have  dealt  with  the  subject  most  fully 
make  a  fourfold  division,  identical  with  that  which 
is  made  in  the  case  of  barbarisms  :  solecisms  are 
brought  about  by  addition,  for  instance  in  phrases 
such  as  nam  enim,  de  susitm,  in  Alexandnam  ;  by  39 
omission,  in  phrases  such  as  ambulo  viam,  Ae^npio 
venio,  or  ne  hoc  fecit :  and  by  transposition  as  in 
qitoqne  ego,  enim  hoc  voluit,  aulcm  non  habuit.1  L'mler 
this  last  head  comes  the  question  whether  igitur  can 
be  placed  first  in  a  sentence  :  for  I  note  that  authors 
of  the  first  rank  disagree  on  this  point,  some  of 
them  frequently  placing  it  in  that  position,  others 
never.  Some  distinguish  these  three  classes  of  40 
error  from  the  solecism,  styling  addition  a  pleonasm, 
omission  an  ellipse.,  and  transposition  anastrophe:  and 
they  assert  that  if  anastrophe  is  a  solecism,  hi/perbaton 
mMit  also  be  so  called.  About  substitution,  that  is  41 

t?  * 

when  one  word  is  used  instead  of  another,  there  is 
no  dispute.  It  is  an  error  which  we  may  detect  in 
connexion  with  all  the  parts  of  speech,  but  most 
frequently  in  the  verb,  because  it  has  greater  variety 

town.  Quoque,  enim  and  autcrn  cannot  come  first  in  a 
sentence  Ambulo  per  viam,  ab  Aegypto  venio,  nc  hoc 
quidem  fecit  would  be  the  correct  Latin.

than  any  other  :  consequently  in  connexion  with  the 
verb  we  get  solecisms  of  gender,  tense,  person  and 
mood  (or  "states"  or  "qualities"  if  you  prefer  either 
of  these  terms),  be  these  types  of  error  six  in  number, 
as  some  assert,  or  eight  as  is  insisted  by  others  (for 
the  number  of  the  forms  of  solecism  will  depend  on 
the  number  of  subdivisions  which  you  assign  to  the 
parts  of  speech  of  which  we  have  just  spoken). 
Further  there  are  solecisms  of  number ;  now  Latin  42 
has  two  numbers,  singular  and  plural,  while  Greek 
possesses  a  third,  namely  the  dual.  There  have 
however  been  some  who  have  given  us  a  dual  as 
well  in  words  such  as  scripsere  and  Icgere,  in  which 
as  a  matter  of  fact  the  final  syllable  has  been 
softened  to  avoid  harshness,  just  as  in  old  writers 
we  find  male  merere  for  male  mereris.  Consequently 
what  they  assert  to  be  a  dual  is  concerned  solely 
with  this  one  class  of  termination,  whereas  in  Greek 
it  is  found  throughout  the  whole  structure  of  the 
verb  and  in  nouns  as  well,  though  even  then  it  is 
but  rarely  used.  But  we  find  not  a  trace  of  such  a  43 
usage  in  any  Latin  author.  On  the  contrary  phrases 
such  as  devenere  locos,1  con  lieu  ere  omnes,2  and 
consedere  duces b  clearly  prove  that  they  have  no- 
thing to  do  with  the  dual.  Moreover  dixeref  al- 
though Antonius  Kufus  cites  it  as  proof  to  the 
contrary,  is  often  used  by  the  usher  in  the  courts  to 
denote  more  than  two  advocates.  Again,  does  not  44 
Livy  near  the  beginning  of  his  first  book  write 
leniiere  arcem  Sabini 5  and  later  in  adversum  JRomani 
subiere  ?  But  I  can  produce  still  better  authority. 
For  Cicero  in  his  Orator  says,  "  I  have  no  objection 

6  Liv.    i.  xii.:    "The  Sabines   held   the   citadel."     "The 
Romans  marched  up  the  slope  against  them."

to  the  form  scripsere,  though  I  regard  scripserunt  as 
the    more    correct."  l       Similarly   in    vocables    and  45 
nouns   solecisms   occur    in    connexion    with     gender, 
number  and    more    especially  case,  by   substitution 
of    one     for    another.      To    these    may    be    added 
solecisms  in  the  u?,e  of  comparatives  and  superlatives, 
or    the    employment    of     patronymics    instead    of 
possessives  and  vice  versa.     As  for  solecisms  connected  46 
with   expressions  of  quantity,  there   are  some   who 
will  regard  phrases  such  as  magnum  peculiolum2  as  a 
solecism,  because  the  diminutive  is  used  instead  of 
the  ordinary  noun,  which  implies  no  diminution.       I 
think  I  should  call  it  a  misuse  of  the  diminutive  rather 
than  a  solecism  ;  for  it  is  an  error  of  sense,  whereas 
solecisms  are  not  errors  of  sense,  but  rather  faulty 
combinations    of    words.        As    regards    participles,  47 
solecisms  occur  in  case  and  gender  as  with  nouns,  in 
tense   as    with    verbs,  and    in   number    as    in    both. 
The  pronoun  admits  of  solecisms  in  gender,  number 
and    case.       Solecisms    also    occur    with    great    fre-  48 
quency    in    connexion    with    parts  of  speech  :    but 
a    bare    statement    on  this    point   is    not   sufficient, 
as    it   may    lead    a    boy    to    think    that    such    error 
consists    only    in    the    substitution    of  one    part    of 
speech    for    another,    as    for    instance    if  a    verb   is 
placed  where  we  require  a  noun,  or  an  adverb  takes 
the  place  of  a  pronoun  and  so  on.     For  there  are  49 
some  nouns  which  are  cognate,  that  is  to  say  of  the 
same  genus,  and  he  who  uses  the  wrong  species  3  in 
connexion   with  one  of  these  will  be  guilty  of  the 
same    offence    as  if  he  were   to    change   the   genus. 
Thus  an  and  aid  are  conjunctions,  but  it  would  be  50 
bad  Latin  to  say  in  a  question  hie  aut  ille  sit*;  ne  and 

4  For  hie  an  illc  sit  ?

non  are  adverbs  :  but  he  who  says  non  feceris  in  lieu 
of  ne  feceris,  is  guilty  of  a  similar  mistake,  since  one 
negative   denies,  while  the  other  forbids.      Further 
intro  and  intus  are  adverbs  of  place,  but  eo  intus  and 
i7itro    sum    are    solecisms.      Similar    errors    may    be   51 
committed  in  connexion   with  the   various  kinds  of 
pronouns,  interjections  and  prepositions.      It  is  also 
a  solecism  l  if  there  is  a  disagreement  between  what 
precedes  and  what  follows  within   the  limits  of   a 
single  clause.    Some  phrases  have  all  the  appearance  52 
of  a  solecism  and  yet  cannot  be  called  faulty ;  take 
for  instance   phrases   such    as  tragoedia    Thyestes   or 
ludi  Floralia  and  Mcgalensia2:    although   these  are 
never  found   in  later  times,  they    are    the    rule   in 
ancient  writers.    We  will  therefore  style  them  figures 
and,  though  their  use  is  more  frequent  in  poets,  will 
not  deny  their  employment  even  to  orators.    Figures 
however    will    generally    have    some    justification,  53 
as  I  shall  show  in  a  later  portion  of  this  work,  which 
I  promised  you  a  little  while  back.3     I  must  how- 
ever point  out  that   a   figure,  if  used    unwittingly, 
will  be  a  solecism.      In  the  same  class,  though  they  54 
cannot  be  called  ficnires.  come  errors  such  as  the  use 

O 

of  masculine  names  with  a  female  termination  and 
feminine  names  with  a  neuter  termination.  I  have 
said  enough  about  solecisms  ;  for  I  did  not  set  out  to 
write  a  treatise  on  grammar,  but  was  unwilling  to 
slight  the  science  by  passing  it  by  without  salutation, 
when  it  met  me  in  the  course  of  my  journey. 

I   therefore  resume  the  path  which   I   prescribed  55 
for   myself   and    point    out    that    words    are    either 

2  Where  strict  grammar  would  require  tragoedia  Thyestis, 
ludi   Florales,   Megalenses.      The  normal   usage  would   be 
simply  to  say  Thyestes,  Floralia,  Megalensia.

native  or  foreign.      Foreign  words,  like  our  population 
and  our  institutions,  have  come  to  us  from  practically 
every  nation  upon  earth.      I  pass  by  words  of  Tuscan,   56 
Sabine  and   Praenestine  origin  ;  for  though   Lucilius 
attacks  Vettius  for  using  them,  and    Pollio  reproves 
Livy  for  his  lapses  into  the  dialect  of  Padua,  I  may  be 
allowed  to  regard  all  such  words  as  of  native  origin. 
Many  Gallic  words  have  become  current    coin,  such   57 
as     raeda     (chariot)     and    pctorritum     (four-wheeled 
wao-on)  of  which  Cicero  uses  the  former  and   Horace 

C™1  / 

the  latter.  Mappa  (napkin)  again,  a  word  familiar 
in  connexion  with  the  circus,  is  claimed  by  the 
Carthaginians,  while  I  have  heard  that  gurdus,  which 
is  colloquially  used  in  the  sense  of  "stupid,"  is 
derived  from  Spain.  But  this  distinction  between  58 
native  and  foreign  words  has  reference  chiefly  to 
Greek.  For  Latin  is  largely  derived  from  that 
language,  and  we  use  words  which  are  admittedly 

o  ~      ^  * 

Greek  to  express  things  for  which  we  have  no  Latin 
equivalent.  Similiarly  they  at  times  borrow  words 
from  us.  In  this  connexion  the  problem  arises 
whether  foreign  words  should  be  declined  according 

O  *-* 

to  their  language  or  our  own.      If  you    come  across   59 

O  O  • 

an  archaistic  grammarian,  he  will  insist  on  absolute 

o 

conformity  to  Latin  practice,  because,  since  we  have 
an  ablative  and  the  Greeks  have  not,  it  would  be 
absurd  in  declining  a  word  to  use  rive  Greek 
cases  and  one  Latin.  He  will  also  praise  the  60 
patriotism  of  those  who  aimed  at  strengthening  the 
Latin  language  and  asserted  that  we  had  no  need 
of  foreign  practices.  They,  therefore,  pronounced 
Castorem  with  the  second  syllable  long  to  bring  it 
into  conformity  with  all  those  Latin  nouns  which 
have  the  same  termination  in  the  nominative  as

Castor.  They  also  insisted  on  the  forms  Palaemo, 
Telamo,  and  Plato  (the  last  being  adopted  by  Cicero), 
because  they  could  not  find  any  Latin  nouns  ending 
in  -on.  They  were  reluctant  even  to  permit  61 
masculine  Greek  nouns  to  end  in  -as  in  the  nomin- 
ative case,  and  consequently  in  Caelius  \ve  find  Pdia 
cincinnatus  and  in  Messala  bene  fecit  Euthia,  and  in 
Cicero  Hermagora.1  So  we  need  not  be  surprised 
that  the  majority  of  early  writers  said  Aenea  and 
Anchisa.  For,  it  was  urged,  if  such  words  are  spelt  62 
like  Maecenas,  Sufenas  and  Asprenas,  the  genitive 
should  terminate  in  -tis  not  in  -e.  On  the  same 
principle  they  placed  an  acute  accent  on  the  middle 
syllable  of  Olympus  and  tyrannus,  because  Latin  does 
not  allow  an  acute  accent  on  the  first  syllable  if  it  is 
short  and  is  followed  by  two  long  syllables.  So  too  Q'3 
we  get  the  Latinised  genitives  Ulixi  and  Achilli  to- 
gether with  many  other  analogous  forms.  More  recent 
scholars  have  instituted  the  practice  of  giving  Greek 
nouns  their  Greek  declension,  although  this  is  not 
always  possible.  Personally  I  prefer  to  follow  the 
Latin  method,  so  far  as  grace  of  diction  will  permit. 
For  I  should  not  like  to  say  Cahjpsonem  on  the  analogy 
of  lunonem,  although  Gaius  Caesar  in  deference  to 
antiquity  does  adopt  this  way  of  declining  it.  Current 
practice  has  however  prevailed  over  his  authority.  In  64 
other  words  which  can  be  declined  in  either  way 
without  impropriety,  those  who  prefer  it  can  employ 
the  Greek  form  :  they  will  not  be  speaking  Latin, 
but  will  not  on  the  other  hand  deserve  censure. 

Simple  words  are  what   they  are  in   the   nomin-   65 
ative,    that    is,    their    essential    nature.      Compound 

1  This   form   does    not    actually    occur   in    Cicero,  MSS. 
evidently  wrongly  giving  Hermagoras.

1  Quintilian  regards  the  negative  in  as  a  preposition.  His 
objection  to  imperterritus  (which  is  used  by  Vergil)  seems 
to  lie  in  the  fact  that  while  inierritus  is  a  natural  way  of 
expressing  "  unterrified,"  it  is  unreasonable  to  negative  per- 
territus,  which  means  "  thoroughly  terrified."  The  presence 
of  the  intensifying  per  conflicts  with  the  force  of  the 
negative  in.  2  Orat.  xlv.  154.

BOOK    I.  v.  65-68 

words  are  formed  by  the  prefix  of  a  preposition  as 
in  innocens,  though  care  must  be  taken  that  two 
conflicting  prepositions  are  not  prefixed  as  in 
imperteriitus1 :  if  this  be  avoided  they  may  in  certain 
cases  have  a  double  prefix  as  in  incompositus  or 
reconditus  or  the  Ciceronian  subabsurdum.  They  may 
also  be  formed  by  what  I  might  term  the  com- 
bination of  two  independent  units,  as  in  male/icus. 
For  I  will  not  admit  that  the  combination  of  three  66 
is  possible  at  any  rate  in  Latin,  although  Cicero 
asserts  that  capsis  2  is  compounded  of  cape  si  vis,  and 
there  are  to  be  found  scholars  who  contend  that 
Lupercalia  likewise  is  a  compound  of  three  parts  of 
speech,  namely  lucre  per  caprum.  As  for  Solitaurilia  67 
it  is  by  now  universally  believed  to  stand  for 
Suovetaurilia,  a  derivation  which  corresponds  to  the 
actual  sacrifice,  which  has  its  counterpart  in  Homer3 
as  well.  But  these  compounds  are  formed  not  so 
much  from  three  words  as  from  the  fragments  of 
three.  On  the  other  hand  Pacuvius  seems  to  have 
formed  compounds  of  a  preposition  and  two  vocables 
(i.e.  nouns)  as  in 

Nerei  repandirostrum  incurvicervicum  pecus  : 

"The  flock 
Of  Nereus  snout-uplifted,  neck-inarched  "  : 

the  effect  is  unpleasing.  Compounds  are  however  68 
formed  from  two  complete  Latin  words,  as  for  in- 
stance super fui  and  subterfugi ;  though  in  this  case 
there  is  some  question  as  to  whether  the  words  from 
which  they  are  formed  are  complete.4  They  may 
also  be  formed  of  one  complete  and  one  incomplete 

4  i.e.  if  both   elements  are  complete  in  themselves  is  the 
word  a  true  compound  ?

word,  as  in  the  case  of  malevolus,  or  of  one  incom- 
plete   and    one    complete,  such   as    noctivagus,  or  of 

two  incomplete  words  as  in  pedisecus  (footman),  or 
from  one  Latin  and  one  foreign  word  as  in  biclinium 
(a  dining-couch  for  two),  or  in  the  reverse  order 
as  in  epitogium  (an  upper  garment)  or  Anticato,  and 
sometimes  even  from  two  foreign  words  as  in 
epiraedium  (a  thong  attaching  the  horse  to  the  raeda). 
For  in  this  last  case  the  preposition  is  Greek,  while 
raeda  is  Gallic,  while  the  compound  is  employed 
neither  by  Greek  nor  Gaul,  but  has  been  appro- 
priated by  Rome  from  the  two  foreign  tongues.  In  69 
the  case  of  prepositions  they  are  frequently  changed 
by  the  act  of  compounding:  as  a  result  we  get 
abslulit,  aufiigit,  amisit,  though  the  preposition  is  ab, 
and  coil,  though  the  preposition  is  con.  The  same  is 
true  of  ignauus  and  erepublica.1  But  compounds  are  70 
better  suited  to  Greek  than  to  Latin,  though  I  do 
not  think  that  this  is  due  to  the  nature  of  our 
language :  the  reason  rather  is  that  we  have  a 
preference  for  foreign  goods,  and  therefore  receive 
Kvpravx^v  with  applause,  whereas  we  can  scarce 
defend  incurvicervicus  from  derisive  laughter. 

Words  are  proper  when  they  bear  their  original  71 
meaning ;  metaphorical,  when  they  are  used  in  a 
sense  different  from  their  natural  meaning.  Current 
words  are  safest  to  use  :  there  is  a  spice  of  danger  in 
coining  new.  For  if  they  are  adopted,  our  style 
wins  but  small  "-lorv  from  them  ;  while  if  they  are

rejected,  they  become  a  subject  for  jest.     Still  we  72 
must  make  the   venture;   for    as    Cicero2   says,  use 
softens  even  these  words  which  at  first  seemed  harsh. 
On  the  other  hand  the  power  of  onomatopoeia  is  denied 
us.     Who    would    tolerate    an    attempt     to    imitate

bow  twanged,"  and  cri£ej/  6<f>8a\/ji6<;,z  "  the  eye

using  balare  "to  baa,"  and  hinmre,  "  to  whinny/'  if 
we  had  not  the  sanction  of  antiquity  to  support  us. 

VI.  There  are  special  rules  which  must  be  ob- 
served both  by  speakers  and  writers.  Language  is 
based  on  reason,  antiquity,  authority  and  usage. 
Reason  finds  its  chief  support  in  analogy  and  some- 
times in  etymology.  As  for  antiquity,  it  is  commen- 
ded to  us  by  the  possession  of  a  certain  majesty,  I 
might  almost  say  sanctity.  Authority  as  a  rule  we  2 
derive  from  orators  and  historians.  For  poets,  owing 
to  the  necessities  of  metre,  are  allowed  a  certain 
licence  except  in  cases  where  they  deliberately 
choose  one  of  two  expressions,  when  both  are  metri- 
cally possible,  as  for  instance  in  imo  de  stirpe  red  sum 
and  aeriae  quo  congessere  palumbes  or  silice  in  nuda  a 
and  the  like.  The  judgment  of  a  supreme  orator 
is  placed  on  the  same  level  as  reason,  and  even  error 
brings  no  disgrace,  if  it  result  from  treading  in  the 
footsteps  of  such  distinguished  guides.  Usage  3 
however  is  the  surest  pilot  in  speaking,  and  we 
should  treat  language  as  currency  minted  with 
the  public  stamp.  But  in  all  these  cases  we  have 
need  of  a  critical  judgment,  especially  as  regards 
analogy  (a  Greek  term  for  which  a  Latin  equivalent 
has  been  found  in  proportion}.  The  essence  of  analogy  4 
is  the  testing  of  all  subjects  of  doubt  by  the  applica- 
tion of  some  standard  of  comparison  about  which 
there  is  no  question,  the  proof  that  is  to  say  of  the 
uncertain  by  reference  to  the  certain.  This  can  be 
done  in  two  different  ways  :  by  comparing  similar 
words,  paying  special  attention  to  their  final  syllables

(hence  monosyllables  are  asserted  to  lie  outside  the 
domain  of  analogy1}  and  by  the  study  of  diminutives. 
Comparison  of  nouns  will  reveal  either  their  gender  5 
or  their  declension  :  in  the  first  case,  supposing  the 
question  is  raised  as  to  whether  Junis  be  masculine 
or  feminine,  panis  will. supply  a  standard  of  compari- 
son :  in  the  second  case,  supposing  we  are  in  doubt 
as  to  whether  we  should  say  hac  dornu  or  hac  domo, 
dommim  or  domorum,  the  standard  of  comparison  will 
be  found  in  words  such  as  anus  or  manus.  Diminutives  6 
merely  reveal  the  gender  :  for  instance,  to  return  to 
a  word  previously  used  as  an  illustration,  fitniculus 
proves  that  funis  is  masculine.  The  same  standard  7 
may  be  applied  in  the  case  of  verbs.  For  instance 
if  it  should  be  asserted  that  the  middle  syllable  of 
fervere  is  short,  we  can  prove  this  to  be  an  error, 
because  all  verbs  which  in  the  indicative  terminate 
in  -eoy  make  the  middle  syllable  of  the  infinitive 
long,  if  that  syllable  contain  an  e :  take  as  examples 
such  verbs  as  prandeo3pendeo,  spondeo  with  infinitives 
prandere,  pendcre,  spondere.  Those  verbs,  however,  8 
which  terminate  in  -o  alone,  if  they  form  the  infini- 
tive in  e,  have  the  e  short ;  compare  lego,  dico,  curro, 
with  the  infinitives,  legere,  diccre,  currere.  I  admit 
that  in  Lucilius  we  find— 

fervit  aqua  et  fervet  :  fervit  nuncfervet  ad  annum.  2 

"  The  water  boils  and  boil  it  will ;  it  boils  and  for  a 
year  will  boil." 

But  with  all  due  respect  to  so  learned  a  man,  if  he 
regards  fervit  as  on  the  same  footing  as  currit   and 
Legit,  we  shall  say  fervo  as  we  say  lego  and  curro  :  9 
but  such   a   form  has  never   yet  come  to  my  ears. 
But  this   is  not  a   true   comparison  :    for  fervit    re-

quia    prima    positio    paciscor,   cum    haberet    naturam

vetustate   exoleverat,  apparebat  paco  ut  cado,  unde

meminerimus   non   per  omnia   duci  analogiae    posse

sembles  servit,  and  on  this  analogy  we  should  say 
fervire  like  servire.  It  is  also  possible  in  certain  10 
cases  to  discover  the  present  indicative  of  a  verb  from 
the  study  of  its  other  tenses.  I  remember,  for  in- 
stance, refuting  certain  scholars  who  criticised  me  for 
using  the  word  pepigi :  for,  although  they  admitted 
that  it  had  been  used  by  some  of  the  best  authors, 
they  asserted  that  it  was  an  irrational  form  because 
the  present  indicative  paciscor,  being  passive  in 
form,  made  pactus  sum  as  its  perfect.  I  in  addition  1 1 
to  quoting  the  authority  of  orators  and  historians 
maintained  that  I  was  also  supported  by  analogy. 
For  when  I  found  ni  ita  pacunt  in  the  Twelve  Tables, 
I  noted  that  cadunt  provided  a  parallel  :  it  was  clear 
therefore  that  the  present  indicative,  though  now 
obsolete,  was  paco  on  the  analogy  of  cado,  and  it 
was  further  obvious  that  we  say  pepigi  for  just  the 
same  reason  that  we  say  cecidi.  But  we  must  12 
remember  that  analogy  cannot  be  universally  applied, 
as  it  is  often  inconsistent  with  itself.  It  is  true 
indeed  that  scholars  have  attempted  to  justify  certain 
apparent  anomalies  :  for  example,  when  it  is  noted 
to  what  an  extent  lepus  and  lupus,  which  resemble 
each  other  closely  in  the  nominative,  differ  in  the 
plural  and  in  the  other  cases,  they  reply  that  they 
are  not  true  parallels,  since  lepus  is  epicene,  while 
lupus  is  masculine,  although  Varro  in  the  book  in 
which  he  narrates  the  origins  of  Rome,  writes  lupus 
femina,  following  the  precedent  of  Ennius  and 
Fabius  Pictor.  The  same  scholars,  however,  when  13 
asked  why  aper  became  apri  in  the  genitive,  but  pater 
patris,  asserted  that  aper  was  an  absolute,  pater 
a  relative  noun.  Further  since  both  words  derive 
from  the  Greek,  they  took  refuge  in  the  fact

nunquam  tamen  eadem  ris  syllaba  terminates,  Ceres 

15  cogat  dici  Cereris  ?     Quid  vero  ?  quod  tota  positionis 
eiusdem   in   diversos    flexus   eunt?    cum  Alba  faciat

siquidem  facit  cado  cecidi,  spondeo  spopondi,  pin  go  pinxi,

enim,   cum    primum    fingerentur    homines,    analogia 
demissa  caelo   formam   loquendi  dedit,   sed  inventa 
est  postquam   loquebantur,   et  notatum    in   sermone

that  TraTpds  provides  a  parallel  to  patris  and 
to  apri.  But  how  will  they  evade  the  difficulty  14 
that  feminine  nouns  whose  nominative  singular 
ends  in  -us  never  make  the  genitive  end  in  -ris, 
and  yet  the  genitive  of  Venus  is  Vcneris :  again 
nouns  ending  in  -es  have  various  genitive  ter- 
minations, but  never  end  in  -ris,  but  yet  we  have 
no  choice  but  to  make  the  genitive  of  Ceres  Cereris? 
Again  what  of  those  words  which,  although  identi-  15 
cal  in  the  form  of  the  nominative  or  present  indica- 
tive, develop  the  utmost  variety  in  their  inflections. 
Thus  from  Alba  we  get  both  Albanus  and  Albensis, 
from  volo  both  volui  and  volavi.  Analogy  itself 
admits  that  verbs  whose  present  indicative  ends  in 
-o  have  a  great  variety  of  perfect  formations,  as 
for  instance  cado  cecidi,  spondco  spopondi,  pingo  pinxi, 
lego  legi,  pono  posui,frangofregi}  laudo  laudavi.  For  16 
analogy  was  not  sent  down  from  heaven  at  the 
creation  of  mankind  to  frame  the  rules  of  language, 
but  was  discovered  after  they  began  to  speak  and  to 
note  the  terminations  of  words  used  in  speech.  It 
is  therefore  based  not  on  reason  but  on  example, 
nor  is  it  a  law  of  language,  but  rather  a  practice 
which  is  observed,  being  in  fact  the  offspring  of 
usage.  Some  scholars,  however,  are  so  perverse  and  17 
obstinate  in  their  passion  for  analogy,  that  they  say 
audaciter  in  preference  to  audacter,,  the  form  preferred 
by  all  orators,  and  emicaiit  for  emicuit,  and  conire 
for  coire.  We  may  permit  them  to  say  audivisse, 
scivisse,  tribunale  and  faclliter,  nor  will  we  deprive 
them  of  frugally  as  an  alternative  for  frugl  :  for 
from  what  else  can frngalitas  be  formed?  They  may  18 
also  be  allowed  to  point  out  that  phrases  such  as 
centum  milia  nummum  and  Jidem  deum l  involve  a

double  solecism,   since  they  change  both  case  and 
number.     Of    course  we   were    in  blank    ignorance 
of  the  fact  and  were  not  simply  conforming  to  usage 
and  the  demands  of  elegance,  as  in  the  numerous 
cases,    with    which    Cicero    deals    magnificently,  as 
always,  in  his  Orator.1    Augustus  again  in  his  letters  19 
to  (.laius  Caesar   corrects   him  for  preferring  calidus 
to  caldns,  riot  on  the  ground  that  the  former  is  not 
Latin,  but  because  it  is  unpleasing  and  as  he  himself 
puts  it  in  Greek  Treptepyov    (affected).       Some    hold  20 
that  this  is  just  a  question  of  op#oeVeta  or  correctness 
of  speech,  a  subject  to   which   I  am  far  from  being 
indifferent.      For  what  can   be  more  necessary  than 

•/ 

that  we  should  speak  correctly  ?  Nay,  I  even  think 
that,  as  far  as  possible,  we  should  cling  to  correct 
forms  and  resist  all  tendencies  to  change.  But  to 
attempt  to  retain  forms  long  obsolete  and  extinct 
is  sheer  impertinence  and  ostentatious  pedantry. 
I  would  suggest  that  the  ripe  scholar,  who  says  "ave"  21 
without  the  aspirate  and  with  a  long  e  (for  it  comes 
from  arere),  and  uses  calefacere  and  conservavisse  in 
preference  to  the  usual  forms,2  should  also  add  face, 
dice  and  the  like  to  his  vocabulary.  His  way  is  the  22 
right  way.  Who  doubts  it  ?  But  there  is  an  easier 
and  more  frequented  path  close  by.  There  is, 
however,  nothing  which  annoys  me  more  than  their 
habit  not  merely  of  inferring  the  nominative  from 
the  oblique  cases,  but  of  actually  altering  it.  For 
instance  in  ebur  and  robur,  the  forms  regularly  used 
both  in  writing  and  speech  by  the  best  authors, 
these  gentlemen  change  their  second  syllable  to  o, 
because  their  genitives  are  roboris  and  eboris,  and  be- 
cause sulpur  and  gidtur  keep  the  u  in  the  genitive.  So 
too  femur  and  iecur  give  rise  to  similar  controversy.

minus  est  licentiosum,  quam  si  sulpuri  et  gutturi 
subiicerent  in  genitive  litteram  o  mediam,  quia  esset 
ebons  et  roboris  ;  sicut  Antonius  Gnipho,  qui  robur 
quidem  et  ebur  atque  etiarn  marmur  faletur  esse, 
verum  fieri  vult  ex  liis  robnra,  ebur  a,  marmur  a. 

24  Quodsi       animadverterent     litterarum     adfinitatem, 
scirent   sic  ab  eo,  quod   est  robur,   roboris  fieri,  quo- 
modo  ab  eo,  quod  est  miles  limes,  militis  limitis,  index 
vindex,    iudicis     lindicis,    et     quae     supra    iam    attigi. 

25  Quid  vero  quod,    ut    dicebam,   similes  positiones  in 
longe  diversas  figuras  per  obliquos  casus  exeunt,  ut 
virgo  luno,  fusus   lusus,   cuspis  puppis   et    mille   alia  ? 
cum  illud   etiam  accidat,  ut  quaedam   pluraliter  non 
dicantur,  quaedam  contra  singular!  numero,  quaedam 
casibus  careant,  quaedam  a  primis;  statim  positionibus

senatus  senati  an  senaius  facial,  incertum  sit  ?     Quare

Their  proceedings  are  just  as  arbitrary  as  if  they  23 
were  to  substitute  an  o  in  the  genitives  of  sulpur 
and  gutlur  on  the  analogy  of  eboris  and  roboris. 
Thus  Antonius  Gnipho  while  admitting  robur,  ebur 
and  even  marmur  to  be  correct,  would  have  their 
plurals  to  be  ebura,  robura  and  mannura.  If  they  24 
would  only  pay  attention  to  the  affinities  existing 
between  letters,  they  would  realize  that  robur  makes 
its  genitive  roboris  in  precisely  the  same  way  that 
Limes,  miles,  index  and  uindcx  make  their  genitives 
militis,  limitis,  iudicis  and  uindicis,  not  to  mention  other 
words  to  which  I  have  already  referred.  Do  not  nouns  25 

•/ 

which  are  similar  in  the  nominative  show,  as  I  have 
already  observed,  quite  different  terminations  in  the 
oblique  cases  ?  Compare  uirgo  and  Juno,  lusus  and 
fusns,  cu&pis  and  puppis  and  a  thousand  others. 
Again  some  nouns  are  not  used  in  the  plural,  while 
others  are  not  used  in  the  singular,  some  are  inde- 
clinable, while  others,  like  Jupiter,  in  the  oblique 
cases  entirely  abandon  the  form  of  the  nominative.  26 
The  same  is  true  of  verbs  :  for  instance  fero  dis- 

t/ 

appears  in  the  perfect  and  subsequent  tenses.  Nor 
does  it  matter  greatly  whether  such  forms  are  non- 
existent or  too  harsh  to  use.  For  what  is  the  geni- 
tive singular  of  progenies  or  the  genitive  plural  ofspes? 
Or  how  will  quire  and  mere  form  a  perfect  passive  or 
passive  participles.  Why  should  I  mention  other  27 
words  when  it  is  even  doubtful  whether  the  genitive 
of  senatus  is  senati  or  senatus  ?  In  view  of  what  I 
have  said,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  remark,  that  it 
is  one  thing  to  speak  Latin  and  another  to  speak 
grammar,  was  far  from  unhappy.  So  much  for 
analogy,  of  which  I  have  said  more  than  enough.

was  called  notation  by  Cicero,1  on  the  ground  that 
the  term  used  by  Aristotle2  is  cru/xftoAov,  which  may 
be  translated  by  nota.  A  literal  rendering  of  eYu//oA.oyia 
would  be  ueritoquium,  a  form  which  even  Cicero,  its 
inventor,  shrinks  from  using.  Some  again,  with  an 
eye  to  the  meaning  of  the  word,  call  it  origination. 
Etymology  is  sometimes  of  the  utmost  use,  when-  29 
ever  the  word  under  discussion  needs  interpretation. 
For  instance  Marcus  Caelius  wishes  to  prove  that  he 
is  homo  frugi,  not  because  he  is  abstemious  (for  he 
could  not  even  pretend  to  be  that),  but  because  he 
is  useful  to  many,  that  is  frucluosus,  from  which 
frugalitas  is  derived.  Consequently  we  find  room 
for  etymology  when  we  are  concerned  with  de- 
finitions. Sometimes  again  this  science  attempts  to  30 
distinguish  between  correct  forms  and  barbarisms,  as 
for  instance  when  we  are  discussing  whether  we 
should  call  Sicily  Triquetra  or  Triqutdra,  or  say 
meridies  or  medidies,  not  to  mention  other  words 
which  depend  on  current  usage.  Such  a  science  31 
demands  profound  erudition,  whether  we  are  deal- 
ing with  the  large  number  of  words  which  are 

O  O 

derived  from  the  Greek,  more  especially  those 
inflected  according  to  the  practice  of  the  Aeolic 
dialect,  the  form  of  Greek  which  most  nearly 
resembles  Latin  ;  or  are  using  ancient  historians  as 
a  basis  for  inquiry  into  the  origin  of  names  of  men, 
places,  nations  and  cities.  For  instance  what  is  the 
origin  of  names  such  as  Brutus,  Publicola,  or  Pythicus  ? 
Why  do  we  speak  of  Latium,  Italia  or  Beneventum  ? 
What  is  the  reason  for  employing  such  names  as 
Capitolium,  collis  Quirmalis  or  Argiletum  ?  3

enthusiasts     for     etymology    give     themselves     an

infinity  of  trouble,  restoring  to  their  true  form  words 
which  have  become  slightly  altered  :  the  methods 
which  they  employ  are  varied  and  manifold  :  they 
shorten  them  or  lengthen  them,  add,  remove,  or 
interchange  letters  and  syllables  as  the  case  may  be. 
As  a  result  perverseness  of  judgment  leads  to  the 
most  hideous  absurdities.  I  am  ready  to  admit  that 
consul  may  be  derived  from  considere  in  the  sense  of 
consulting  or  judging;  for  the  ancients  used  con- 
sulere  in  the  latter  sense,  and  it  still  survives  in  the 
phrase  rogal  boni  consulas,  that  is  honum  indices,  "judge 
fit."  Again  senatus  may  well  be  derived  from  old  33 
age  (for  the  senators  are  called  "the  fathers"): 
I  concur  in  the  derivations  assigned  to  rex  rector 
to  say  nothing  of  many  other  words  where  there 
can  be  no  doubt,  and  do  not  refuse  to  accept  those 
suggested  for  tegula,  regula  and  the  like  :  let  classis 
be  from  calare  (call  out,  summon),  lepus  be  a  con- 
traction of  levipes  and  vulpes  of  volipes.  But  are  we  34 
also  to  admit  the  derivation  of  certain  words  from 
their  opposites,  and  accept  lucus  a  non  lucendo,  since 
a  grove  is  dark  with  shade,  Indus  in  the  sense  of 
school  as  being  so  called  because  it  is  quite  the 
reverse  of  "  play  "  and  Dis,  Ditis  from  diues,  because 
Pluto  is  far  from  being  rich  ?  Are  we  to  assent  to 
the  view  that  homo  is  derived  from  humus,  because 
man  sprang  from  the  earth,  as  though  all  other 
living  things  had  not  the  same  origin  or  as  if 
primitive  man  gave  the  earth  a  name  before  giving 
one  to  himself?  Or  again  can  verbum  be  derived 
from  aer  verberatus,  "beaten  air"?  Let  us  go  a  35 
little  further  and  we  shall  find  that  stella  is  believed 
to  be  still  a  luminis  "a  drop  of  light,"  a  derivation 
whose  author  is  so  famous  in  literature  that  it  would

be  unkind  to  mention  his  name  in  connexion  with  a 
point  where  he  comes  in  for  censure.  But  those  36 
who  collected  such  derivations  in  book  form,  put 
their  names  on  the  title  page ;  and  Gavius  thought 
himself  a  perfect  genius  when  he  identified  caelibes, 
"bachelors/'  with  caelites,  "gods/'  on  the  ground 
that  they  are  free  from  a  heavy  load  of  care,  and 
supported  this  opinion  by  a  Greek  analogy:  for  he 
asserted  that  ^Weoi,  "  young  men/'  had  a  precisely 
similar  origin.  Modestus  is  not  his  inferior  in 
inventive  power :  for  he  asserts  that  caelibes,  that  is 
to  say  unmarried  men,  are  so  called  because  Saturn 
cut  off  the  genital  organs  of  Caelus.  Aelius  asserts 
that  pituita,  "phlegm/'  is  so  called  quia  petal  mtam, 
because  it  attacks  life.  But  we  may  pardon  anyone  37 
after  the  example  set  by  Varro.1  For  he  tried  to 
persuade  Cicero,  to  whom  he  dedicated  his  work, 
that  a  field  was  called  agcr  because  something  is 
done  in  it  (agitur},  and  jackdaws  graculos  because 
they  fly  in  flocks  (gregafini),  in  spite  of  the  obvious 
fact  that  the  first  word  is  derived  from  the  Greek, 
the  latter  from  the  cry  of  the  bird  in  question. 
But  Varro  had  such  a  passion  for  derivations  that  he  38 
derived  the  name  merula  "a  blackbird'  from  mera 
uolans  on  the  ground  that  it  flies  alone !  Some 
scholars  do  not  hesitate  to  have  recourse  to  etymology 
for  the  origin  of  every  word,  deriving  names  such  as 
Rufus  or  Longus  from  the  appearance  of  their 
possessor,  verbs  such  as  strepere  or  munnurare  from 
the  sounds  which  they  represent,  and  even  ex- 
tending this  practice  to  certain  derivatives,  making 
uelox  for  instance  find  its  origin  in  uelocitas,2  as  well 
as  to  compounds  and  the  like  :  now  although  such 
words  doubtless  have  an  origin,  no  special  science  is

required  to  detect  it,  since  it  is  only  doubtful  cases 
that  demand  the  intervention  of  the  etymologist. 

Archaic  words  not  only  enjoy  the  patronage  of  39 
distinguished  authors,  but  also  give  style  a  certain 
majesty  and  charm.  For  they  have  the  authority  of 
age  behind  them,  and  for  the  very  reason  that  they 
have  fallen  into  desuetude,  produce  an  attractive 
effect  not  unlike  that  of  novelty.  But  such  words  40 
must  be  used  sparingly  and  must  not  thrust  them- 
selves upon  our  notice,  since  there  is  nothing  more 
tiresome  than  affectation,  nor  above  all  must  thev  be 
drawn  from  remote  and  forgotten  ages  :  I  refer  to 
words  such  as  topper,  "  quite,"  antegerio,  "  exceed- 
ingly," exanclare,  "to  exhaust,"  prosapia,  "a  race" 
and  the  language  of  the  Salian  Hymns  now  scarcely 
understood  by  its  own  priests.  Religion,  it  is  true,  41 
forbids  us  to  alter  the  words  of  these  hymns  and 
we  must  treat  them  as  sacred  things.  But  what  a 
faulty  thing  is  speech,  whose  prime  virtue  is  clear- 
ness, if  it  requires  an  interpreter  to  make  its  meaning 
plain  !  Consequently  in  the  case  of  old  words  the 
best  will  be  those  that  are  newest,  just  as  in  the 
case  of  new  words  the  best  will  be  the  oldest. 

The  same  arguments  apply  to  authority.  For  42 
although  the  use  of  words  transmitted  to  us  by  the 
best  authors  may  seem  to  preclude  the  possibility 
of  error,  it  is  important  to  notice  not  merely  what 
they  said,  but  what  words  they  succeeded  in  sanction- 
ing. For  no  one  to-day  would  introduce  words  such 
as  tuburchinabundus,  "  voracious,"  or  lurchinabundus, 
"guzzling,"  although  they  have  the  authority  of 
Cato ;  nor  make  lodices,  "blankets,"  masculine, 
though  Pollio  preferred  that  gender;  nor  say  gladi- 
ola,  "small  swords,"  though  Messalaused  this  plural,

nor  parricidatus  for  parricide,  a  form  which  can 
scarcely  be  tolerated  even  in  Caelius,  nor  will  Calvus 
persuade  me  to  speak  of  collos,  "  necks."  Indeed, 
were  these  authors  alive  to-day,  they  would  never 
use  such  words. 

Usage  remains  to  be  discussed.  For  it  would  be  43 
almost  laughable  to  prefer  the  language  of  the 
past  to  that  of  the  present  day,  and  what  is  ancient 
speech  but  ancient  usage  of  speaking  ?  But  even 
here  the  critical  faculty  is  necessary,  and  we  must 
make  up  our  minds  what  we  mean  by  usage.  If  it  44 
be  defined  merely  as  the  practice  of  the  majority, 
we  shall  have  a  very  dangerous  rule  affecting  not 
merely  style  but  life  as  well,  a  far  more  serious 
matter.  For  where  is  so  much  good  to  be  found  that 
what  is  right  should  please  the  majority  ?  The 
practices  of  depilation,  of  dressing  the  hair  in 
tiers,  or  of  drinking  to  excess  at  the  baths,  although 
they  may  have  thrust  their  way  into  society,  can- 
not claim  the  support  of  usage,  since  there  is  some- 
thing to  blame  in  all  of  them  (although  we  have 
usage  on  our  side  when  we  bathe  or  have  our 
hair  cut  or  take  our  meals  together).  So  too  in 
speech  we  must  not  accept  as  a  rule  of  language 
words  and  phrases  that  have  become  a  vicious  habit 
with  a  number  of  persons.  To  say  nothing  of  the  45 
language  of  the  uneducated,  we  are  all  of  us  well 
aware  that  whole  theatres  and  the  entire  crowd  of 
spectators  will  often  commit  barbarisms  in  the  cries 
which  they  utter  as  one  man.  I  will  therefore  define 
usage  in  speech  as  the  agreed  practice  of  educated 
men,  just  as  where  our  way  of  life  is  concerned  I 
should  define  it  as  the  agreed  practice  of  all  good 
men.

VII.  Having  stated  the  rules  which  we  must 
follow  in  speaking,  I  will  now  proceed  to  lay  down 
the  rules  which  must  be  observed  when  we  write. 
Such  rules  are  called  orthography  by  the  Greeks  ;  let 
us  style  it  the  science  of  writing  correctly.  This 
science  does  not  consist  merely  in  the  knowledge  of 
the  letters  composing  each  syllable  (such  a  study 
is  beneath  the  dignity  of  a  teacher  of  grammar), 
but,  in  my  opinion,  develops  all  its  subtlety  in  con- 
nexion with  doubtful  points.  For  instance,  while  it  2 
is  absurd  to  place  a  circumflex  over  all  long  syllables 
since  the  quantity  of  most  syllables  is  obvious  from 
the  very  nature  of  the  word  which  is  written,  it  is 
all  the  same  occasionally  necessary,  since  the  same 
letter  involves  a  different  meaning  according  as  it  is 
long  or  short.  For  example  we  determine  whether 
mains  is  to  mean  an  "apple  tree"  or  a  "bad  man"  by 
the  use  of  the  circumflex  ;  palus  means  a  "stake/'  if  3 
the  first  syllable  is  long,  a  "marsh,"  if  it  be  short ; 
again  when  the  same  letter  is  short  in  the  nominative 
and  long  in  the  ablative,  we  generally  require  the 
circumflex  to  make  it  clear  which  quantity  to  under- 
stand. Similarly  it  has  been  held  that  we  should  4 
observe  distinctions  such  as  the  following  :  if  the 
preposition  ex  is  compounded  with  specto,  there  will 
be  an  s  in  the  second  syllable,  while  there  will  be  no 
s  if  it  is  compounded  with  pecto.  Again  the  follow-  5 
ing  distinction  has  frequently  been  observed  :  ad  is 
spelt  with  a  d  when  it  is  a  preposition,  but  with  a  t 
when  it  is  a  conjunction,  while  cum  is  spelt  quvm 
when  it  denotes  time,  but  cum  when  it  denotes 
accompaniment.  Still  more  pedantic  are  the  practices  6 
of  making  the  fourth  letter  of  quidquid  a  c  to  avoid 
the  appearance  of  repeating  a  question,  and  of  writing

haruspex  enim,  quia  pars  eius  posterior  a  spectando 
est,    s    litteram    tertiae    dabit;     abstemius,    quia    ex 
abstinentia    temeti    composita    vox    est,   primae    re- 

10  linquet.       Nam  k  quidem  in  nullis  verbis  utendum 
puto,   nisi    quae   signirtcat,    etiam    ut    sola    ponatur.

quotidie  instead  of  colidie  to  show  that  it  stands  for 
quot  diebus.  But  such  practices  have  disappeared 
into  the  limbo  of  absurdities. 

It  is  often  debated  whether  in  our  spelling  of  7 
prepositions  we  should  be  guided  by  their  sound 
when  compounded,  or  separate.  For  instance  when 
I  say  optinuit,  logic  demands  that  the  second 
letter  should  be  a  6,  while  to  the  ear  the  sound  is 
rather  that  of  p  :  or  again  take  the  case  of  immunis  :  8 
the  letter  n,  which  is  required  by  strict  adherence  to 
fact,  is  forced  by  the  sound  of  the  m  which  follows 
to  change  into  another  m.  We  must  also  note  when  9 
analysing  compound  words,  whether  the  middle 
consonant  adheres  to  the  preceding  syllable  or  to 
that  which  follows.  For  example  since  the  latter 
part  of  haruspex  is  from  speclare,  the  s  must  be 
assigned  to  the  third  syllable.  In  abstrmius  on  the 
other  hand  it  will  go  with  the  first  syllable  since  the 
word  is  derived  from  abstinentia  temeti,  "  abstention 
from  wine."  As  for  k  my  view  is  that  it  should  not  10 
be  used  at  all  except  in  such  words  as  may  be  indi- 
cated by  the  letter  standing  alone  as  an  abbreviation.1 
I  mention  the  fact  because  some  hold  that  k  should 
be  used  whenever  the  next  letter  is  an  a,  despite 
the  existence  of  the  letter  c  which  maintains  its 
force  in  conjunction  with  all  the  vowels. 

Orthography,  however,  is  also  the  servant  of  usage  1 1 
and  therefore  undergoes  frequent  change.  I  make 
no  mention  of  the  earliest  times  when  our  alphabet 
contained  fewer  letters  2  and  their  shapes  differed 
from  those  which  we  now  use,  while  their  values  also 
were  different.  For  instance  in  Greek  the  letter  o 
was  sometimes  long  and  short,  as  it  is  with  us,  and 
again  was  sometimes  used  to  express  the  syllable

which    is   identical  with    its   name.1      And  in    Latin  12 
ancient  writers  ended  a  number  of  words  with  d,  as 
may  be  seen  on  the  column  adorned  with  the  beaks 
of  ships,  which  was  set  up  in  the  forum  in  honour 
of   Duilius.2     Sometimes    again  they   gave   words  a 
final  g,  as  we  may  still  see  in   the  shrine  of  the  Sun, 
close  to  the  temple  of  Quirinus,  where  we  find  the 
word    uesperug,   which  we  write  uesperugo    (evening 
star).      I    have    already   spoken   of   the  interchange  13 
of  letters  3  and  need   not  repeat  my  remarks  here: 
perhaps  their  pronunciation  corresponded  with  their 
spelling.      For    a    long    time  the   doubling  of  semi-   14 
vowels    was    avoided,4    while    down    to  the  time  of 
Accius  and  beyond,  long  syllables  were  indicated  by 
repetition  of  the  vowel.      The  practice  of  joining  e  15 
and  i  as  in  the  Greek  diphthong  a  lasted  longer  :  it 
served  to  distinguish  cases  and  numbers,  for  which 
we  may  compare  the  instructions  of  Lucilius : 

The  boys  are  come :  why  then,  their  names  must 

end 
With  e  and  t  to  make  them  more  than  one  ; 

and  later — 

If  to  a  thief  and  liar  (mendaci  furique)  you  would 

give, 
In  e  and  i  your  thief  must  terminate. 

•/ 

But  this  addition  of  e  is  quite  superfluous,  since  i  16 
can  be  long  no  less  than  short :   it  is  also  at  times 
inconvenient.      For  in   those  words  which   end   in  i 
and  have  e  as  their  last  letter  but  one,  we  shall  on 
this  principle  have  to  write  e  twice  :   I  refer  to  words 
such  as  aurei  or  argentei  and  the  like.      Now  such  a  17 
practice  will  be  an  actual  hindrance  to  those  who  are 
learning  to  read.      This  difficulty  occurs  in  Greek  as

well  in  connexion  with  the  addition  of  an  iota,  which 
is  employed  not  merely  in  the  termination  of  the 
dative,  but  is  sometimes  found  in  the  middle  of 
words  as  in  ATJ'CTTT;?,  for  the  reason  that  the  analysis 
applied  by  etymology  shows  the  word  to  be  a  tri- 
syllable l  and  requires  the  addition  of  that  letter. 
The  diphthong  ae  now  written  with  an  e,  was  pro-  IS 
nounced  in  old  days  as  ai ;  some  wrote  ai  in  all  cases, 
as  in  Greek,  others  confined  its  use  to  the  dative  and 
genitive  singular  ;  whence  it  comes  that  Vergil,2 
always  a  passionate  lover  of  antiquity,  inserted  pictai 
uestis  and  aquai  in  his  poems.  But  in  the  plural  they  19 
used  e  and  wrote  Syllae,  Galbae.  Lucilius  has  given 
instructions  on  this  point  also ;  his  instructions 
occupy  quite  a  number  of  verses,  for  which  the 
incredulous  may  consult  his  ninth  book.  Again  in  20 
Cicero's  days  and  a  little  later,  it  was  the  almost 
universal  practice  to  write  a  double  s,  whenever  that 
letter  occurred  between  two  long  vowels  or  after  a 
long  vowel,  as  for  example  in  caussae,  cassus,  diuissiones. 
That  he  and  Vergil  both  used  this  spelling  is  shown 
by  their  own  autograph  manuscripts.  And  yet  at  21 
a  slightly  earlier  date  iussi  which  we  write  with  a 
double  s  was  spelt  with  only  one.  Further  optimus 
maximus,  which  older  writers  spelt  with  a  u,  ap- 
pear for  the  first  time  with  an  i  (such  at  any  rate 
is  the  tradition)  in  an  inscription  of  Gaius  Caesar.3 
We  now  write  here,  but  I  still  find  in  manuscripts  of  22 
the  old  comic  poets  phrases  such  as  heri  ad  me  uenitf 
and  the  same  spelling  is  found  in  letters  of  Augustus 
written  or  corrected  by  his  own  hand.  Again  did  23 
not  Cato  the  censor  spell  dicam  and  faciam  as  dicem 

3  Caligula,  the  first  of  the  Caesars  to  adopt  this  title.

and  Jaciem  and  observe  the  same  practice  in  words  of 
similar  termination  ?  This  is  clear  from  old  manu- 
scripts of  his  works  and  is  recorded  by  Mes.sala  in 
his  treatise  on  the  letter  s.  Sibe  and  quase  are  found  24 
in  many  books,  but  I  cannot  say  whether  the 
authors  wished  them  to  be  spelt  thus  :  I  learn  from 
Pedianus  that  Livy,  whose  precedent  he  himself 
adopted,  used  this  spelling  :  to-day  we  make  these 
words  end  with  an  i.  What  shall  I  say  of  uorttces,  25 
uorsus  and  the  like,  which  Scipio  Africanus  is  said 
to  have  been  the  first  to  spell  with  an  e?  My  own  26 
teachers  spelt  sennit  and  ceruus  with  a  uo,  in  order 
that  the  repetition  of  the  vowel  might  not  lead  to 
the  coalescence  and  confusion  of  the  two  sounds : 
to-day  however  we  write  these  words  with  a  double 
u  on  the  principle  which  I  have  already  stated : 
neither  spelling  however  exactly  expresses  the  pro- 
nunciation. It  was  not  without  reason  that  Claudius 
introduced  the  Aeolic  digamma  to  represent  this 
sound.1  It  is  a  distinct  improvement  that  to-day  we  27 
spell  cui  as  I  have  written  it  :  when  I  was  a  boy  it 
used  to  be  spelt  quoi,  giving  it  a  very  full  sound, 
merely  to  distinguish  it  from  qui. 

Again,  what  of  words  whose  spelling  is  at  variance  28 
with  their  pronunciation  ?     For  instance  C  is  used  as 
an  abbreviation  for  Gaius,  and  when  inverted  stands 
for  a  woman,  for  as  we  know  from  the  words  of  the 
marriage   service   women    used  to  be    called   Gaiae, 
just  as   men   were   called  Gaii.2     Gnaeus  too  in  the  29 
abbreviation  indicating  the  praenomen  is  spelt  in  a 
manner  which  does  not  agree  with  its  pronunciation. 
We  also  find  columna  3  and  consul  spelt  without  an  n, 

3  columa  is  mentioned  by  the  grammarian  Pompeius  as  a 
barbarism  in  the  fifth  century,  cp.  dimin.  columella.  Con- 
sul is  abbreviated  cos.

while  Subura  when  indicated  by  three  letters  is  spelt 
Sue.1  I  could  quote  many  other  examples  of  this, 
but  I  fear  that  I  have  already  said  too  much  on  so 

•/ 

trivial  a  theme. 

On  all  such  subjects  the  teacher  must  use  his  own  30 
judgment;  for  in  such  matters  it  should  be  the 
supreme  authority.  For  my  own  part,  I  think  that, 
within  the  limits  prescribed  by  usage,  words  should 
be  spelt  as  they  are  pronounced.  For  the  use  of  31 
letters  is  to  preserve  the  sound  of  words  and  to 
deliver  them  to  readers  as  a  sacred  trust :  conse- 
quently they  ought  to  represent  the  pronunciation 
which  we  are  to  use.  These  are  the  more  important  32 
points  in  connexion  with  writing  and  speaking 
correctly.  I  do  not  go  so  far  as  to  deny  to  the 
teacher  of  literature  all  part  in  the  two  remain- 
ing departments  of  speaking  and  writing  with 
elegance  and  significance,  but  I  reserve  these  for  a 
more  important  portion  of  this  work,  as  I  have  still 
to  deal  with  the  duties  of  the  teacher  of  rhetoric. 

I  am  however  haunted  by  the  thought  that  some  33 
readers  will  regard  what  I  have  said  as  trivial  details 
which  are  only  likely  to  prove  a  hindrance  to  those 
who  are  intent  upon  a  greater  task  ;  and  I  myself 
do  not  think  that  we  should  go  so  far  as  to  lose  our 
sleep  of  nights  or  quibble  like  fools  over  such 
minutiae  ;  for  such  studies  make  mincemeat  of  the 
mind.  But  it  is  only  the  superfluities  of  grammar  34 
that  do  any  harm.  I  ask  you,  is  Cicero  a  less  great 
orator  for  having  given  this  science  his  diligent 
attention  or  for  having,  as  his  letters  show,  demanded 
rigid  correctness  of  speech  from  his  son  ?  Or  was  the 
vigour  of  Gaius  Caesar's  eloquence  impaired  by  the 
publication  of  a  treatise  on  Analogy  ?  Or  the  polish  35

of  Messala  dimmed  by  the  fact  that  he  devoted 
whole  books  to  the  discussion  not  merely  of 
single  words,  but  of  single  letters  ?  Such  studies  do 
no  harm  to  those  who  but  pass  through  them  :  it  is 
only  the  pedantic  stickler  who  suffers. 

VIII.  Reading  remains  for  consideration.  In 
this  connexion  there  is  much  that  can  only  be 
taught  in  actual  practice,  as  for  instance  when  the 
boy  should  take  breath,  at  what  point  he  should 
introduce  a  pause  into  a  line,  where  the  sense  ends 
or  begins,  when  the  voice  should  be  raised  or 
lowered,  what  modulation  should  be  given  to  each 
phrase,  and  when  he  should  increase  or  slacken 
speed,  or  speak  with  greater  or  less  energy.  In  2 
this  portion  of  my  work  I  will  give  but  one  golden 
rule  :  to  do  all  these  things,  he  must  understand 
what  he  reads.  But  above  all  his  reading  must  be 
manly,  combining  dignity  and  charm  ;  it  must  be 
different  from  the  reading  of  prose,  for  poetry  is 
song  and  poets  claim  to  be  singers.  But  this  fact 
does  not  justify  degeneration  into  sing-song  or  the 
effeminate  modulations  now  in  vogue  :  there  is  an 
excellent  saying  on  this  point  attributed  to  Gaius 
Caesar  while  he  was  still  a  boy  :  "If  you  are  singing, 
you  sing  badly :  if  you  are  reading,  you  sing." 
Again  I  do  not,  like  some  teachers,  wish  character  3 
as  revealed  by  speeches  to  be  indicated  as  it  is  by 
the  comic  actor,  though  I  think  that  there  should 
be  some  modulation  of  the  voice  to  distinguish  such 
passages  from  those  where  the  poet  is  speaking  in 
person.  There  are  other  points  where  there  is  much  4 
need  of  instruction  :  above  all,  unformed  minds 
which  are  liable  to  be  all  the  more  deeply  impressed 
by  what  they  learn  in  their  days  of  childish

ignorance,  must  learn  not  merely  what  is  eloquent  ; 
it  is  even  more  important  that  they  should  study 
what  is  morally  excellent. 

It  is  therefore  an  admirable  practice  which  now  0 
prevails,  to  begin  by  reading  Homer  and  Vergil, 
although  the  intelligence  needs  to  be  further  devel- 
oped for  the  full  appreciation  of  their  merits  :  but 
there  is  plenty  of  time  for  that  since  the  boy  will 
read  them  more  than  once.  In  the  meantime  let  his 
mind  be  lifted  by  the  sublimity  of  heroic  verse, 
inspired  by  the  greatness  of  its  theme  and  imbued 
with  the  loftiest  sentiments.  The  reading  of  tragedy  0 
also  is  useful,  and  lyric  poets  will  provide  nourish- 
ment for  the  mind,  provided  not  merely  the  authors 
be  carefully  selected,  but  also  the  passages  from 
their  works  which  are  to  be  read.  For  the  Greek  lyric 
poets  are  often  licentious  and  even  in  Horace  there 
are  passages  which  I  should  be  unwilling  to  explain 
to  a  class.  Elegiacs,  however,  more  especially  erotic 
elegy,  and  hendecasyllables,  which  are  merely  sections 
of  Sotadean  verse  1  (concerning  which  latter  I  need 
give  no  admonitions),  should  be  entirely  banished,  if 
possible  ;  if  not  absolutely  banished,  they  should  be 
reserved  for  pupils  of  a  less  impressionable  age.  As  to 
comedy,  whose  contribution  to  eloquence  may  be  of  7 
no  small  importance,  since  it  is  concerned  with  every 
kind  of  character  and  emotion,  I  will  shortly  point 
out  in  its  due  place2  what  use  can  in  my  opinion 
be  made  of  it  in  the  education  of  boys.  As  soon  as 
we  have  no  fear  of  contaminating  their  morals,  it 
should  take  its  place  among  the  subjects  which  it  is 
specially  desirable  to  read.  I  speak  of  Menander, 
though  I  would  not  exclude  others.  For  Latin  8 
authors  will  also  be  of  some  service.  But  the

subjects  selected  for  lectures  to  boys  should  be  those 
which  will  enlarge  the  mind  and  provide  the  great- 
est nourishment  to  the  intellect.  Life  is  quite  long 
enough  for  the  subsequent  study  of  those  other  sub- 
jects which  are  concerned  with  matters  of  interest 
solely  to  learned  men.  But  even  the  old  Latin  poets 
may  be  of  great  value, in  spite  of  the  fact  that  their 
strength  lies  in  their  natural  talent  rather  than  in 
their  art :  above  all  they  will  contribute  richness 
of  vocabulary  :  for  the  vocabulary  of  the  tragedians 
is  full  of  dignity,  while  in  that  of  the  comedians 
there  is  a  certain  elegance  and  Attic  grace.  They  9 
are,  too,  more  careful  about  dramatic  structure  than 
the  majority  of  moderns,  who  regard  epigram  as  the 
sole  merit  of  every  kind  of  literary  work.  For 
purity  at  any  rate  and  manliness,  if  I  may  say  so, 
we  must  certainly  go  to  these  writers,  since  to-day 
even  our  style  of  speaking  is  infected  with  all  the 
faults  of  modern  decadence.  Finally  we  may  derive  10 
confidence  from  the  practice  of  the  greatest  orators 
of  drawing  upon  the  early  poets  to  support  their 
arguments  or  adorn  their  eloquence.  For  we  find,  11 
more  especially  in  the  pages  of  Cicero,  but  frequent- 
ly in  Asinius  and  other  orators  of  that  period,  quota- 
tions from  Ennius,  Accius,  Pacuvius,  Lucilius, Terence, 
Caecilius  and  others,  inserted  not  merely  to  show 
the  speaker's  learning,  but  to  please  his  hearers 
as  well,  since  the  charms  of  poetry  provide  a  plea- 
sant relief  from  the  severity  of  forensic  eloquence. 
Such  quotations  have  the  additional  advantage  of  12 
helping  the  speaker's  case,  for  the  orator  makes  use 
of  the  sentiments  expressed  by  the  poet  as  evidence 
in  support  of  his  own  statements.  But  while  my 
earlier  remarks  have  special  application  to  the 
education  of  boys,  those  which  I  have  just  made

apply  rather  to  persons  of  riper  years  ;  for  the  love  of 
letters  and  the  value  of  reading  are  not  confined  to 
one's  schooldays,  but  end  only  with  life. 

In  lecturing  the  teacher  of  literature  must  give  13 
attention  to  minor  points  as  well  :  he  will  ask  his 
class  after  analysing  a  verse  to  give  him  the  parts  of 
speech  and  the  peculiar  features  of  the  feet  which 
it  contains  :  these  latter  should  be  so  familiar  in 
poetry  as  to  make  their  presence  desired  even  in 
the  prose  of  oratory.  He  will  point  out  what  words 
are  barbarous,  what  improperly  used,  and  what  are 
contrary  to  the  laws  of  language.  He  will  not  do  14 
this  by  way  of  censuring  the  poets  for  such  pecu- 
liarities, for  poets  are  usually  the  servants  of  their 
metres  and  are  allowed  such  licence  that  faults 
are  given  ether  names  when  they  occur  in  poetry  : 
for  wre  style  them  metaplasms,1  schematisms  and 
schemata?  as  I  have  said,  and  make  a  virtue  of 
necessity.  Their  aim  will  rather  be  to  familiarise  the 
pupil  with  the  artifices  of  style  and  to  stimulate  his 
memory.  Further  in  the  elementary  stages  of  such  15 
instruction  it  will  not  be  unprofitable  to  show  the 
different  meanings  which  may  be  given  to  each  word. 
With  regard  to  glossemata,  that  is  to  say  words  not 
in  common  use,  the  teacher  must  exercise  no  ordi- 
nary diligence,  while  still  greater  care  is  required  in  16 
teaching  all  the  tropes3  which  are  employed  for  the 
adornment  more  especially  of  poetry,  but  of  oratory 
as  well,  and  in  making  his  class  acquainted  with  the 
two  sorts  of  schemata  or  figures  known  as  ^figures  of 
speech  and  ^figures  of  thought*  I  shall  however  post- 

4  vSee  Book  IX.  chaps,  i.  and  ii.  A  trope  is  an  expression 
used  in  a  sense  which  it  cannot  strictly  bear.  A  figure  is  a 
form  of  speech  differing  from  the  ordinary  method  of  expres- 
sion ;  see  ix  i.  4.

pone  discussion  of  tropes  and  figures  till  I  come  to 
deal  with  the  various  ornaments  of  style.  Above  17 
all  he  will  impress  upon  their  minds  the  value  of 
proper  arrangement,  and  of  graceful  treatment  of 
the  matter  in  hand  :  he  will  show  what  is  appropriate 
to  the  various  characters,  what  is  praiseworthy  in  the 
thoughts  or  words,  where  copious  diction  is  to  be 
commended  and  where  restraint. 

In  addition  to  this  he  will  explain  the  various  18 
stories  that  occur :  this  must  be  done  with  care, 
but  should  not  be  encumbered  with  superfluous 
detail.  For  it  is  sufficient  to  set  forth  the  version 
which  is  generally  received  or  at  any  rate  rests  upon 
good  authority.  But  to  ferret  out  everything  that 
has  ever  been  said  on  the  subject  even  by  the  most 
worthless  of  writers  is  a  sign  of  tiresome  pedantry 
or  empty  ostentation,  and  results  in  delaying  and 
swamping  the  mind  when  it  would  be  better 
employed  on  other  themes.  The  man  who  pores  19 
over  every  page  even  though  it  be  wholly  unworthy 
of  reading,  is  capable  of  devoting  his  attention 
to  the  investigation  of  old  wives'  tales.  And  yet 
the  commentaries  of  teachers  of  literature  are  full 
of  such  encumbrances  to  learning  and  strangely 
unfamiliar  to  their  own  authors.  It  is,  for  instance,  20 
recorded  that  Didymus,  who  was  unsurpassed  for 
the  number  of  books  which  he  wrote,  on  one  occasion 
objected  to  some  story  as  being  absurd,  whereupon 
one  of  his  own  books  was  produced  which  contained 
the  story  in  question.  Such  abuses  occur  chiefly  in  21 
connexion  with  fabulous  stories  and  are  sometimes 
carried  to  ludicrous  or  even  scandalous  extremes : 
for  in  such  cases  the  more  unscrupulous  commentator 
has  such  full  scope  for  invention,  that  he  can  tell  lies

frequentissime  deprehenduntur  a  curiosis.  Ex  quo 
mihi  inter  virtutes  grammatici  habebitur  aliqua

IX.  Et  finitae  quidem  sunt  partes  duae,  quas  haec

tum  paraphrasi  audacius  vertere,  qua  et  breviare

3  permittitur.  Quod  opus  etiam  consummatis  pro- 
fessoribus  difficile  qui  commode  tractaverit,  cuicun- 
que  discendo  sufficiet.  Sententiae  quoque  et  chriae 
et  ethologiae  subiectis  dictorum  rationibus  apud 
grammaticos  scribantur,  quia  initium  ex  lectione

1  The  meaning  of  ethologia  is  doubtful,  but  probably  means 
a  simple  character-sketch  of  some  famous  man.

to  his  heart's  content  about  whole  books  and  authors 
without  fear  of  detection  :  for  what  never  existed 
can  obviously  never  be  found,  whereas  if  the  subject 
is  familiar  the  careful  investigator  will  often  detect 
the  fraud.  Consequently  I  shall  count  it  a  merit  in 
a  teacher  of  literature  that  there  should  be  some 
things  which  he  does  not  know. 

IX.  I  have  now  finished  with  two  of  the 
departments,  with  which  teachers  of  literature  pro- 
fess to  deal,  namely  the  art  of  speaking  correctly 
and  the  interpretation  of  authors  ;  the  former  they 
call  metkodice,  the  latter  historice.  We  must  however 
add  to  their  activities  instruction  in  certain  rudiments 
of  oratory  for  the  benefit  of  those  who  are  not  yet 
ripe  for  the  schools  of  rhetoric.  Their  pupils  should  2 
learn  to  paraphrase  Aesop's  fables,  the  natural  suc- 
cessors of  the  fairy  stories  of  the  nursery,  in  simple 
and  restrained  language  and  subsequently  to  set 
down  this  paraphrase  in  writing  with  the  same  sim- 
plicity of  style :  they  should  begin  by  analysing 
each  verse,  then  give  its  meaning  in  different 
language,  and  finally  proceed  to  a  freer  paraphrase  in 
which  they  will  be  permitted  now  to  abridge  and 
now  to  embellish  the  original,  so  far  as  this  may  be 
done  without  losing  the  poet's  meaning.  This  is  no  3 
easy  task  even  for  the  expert  instructor,  and  the 
pupil  who  handles  it  successfully  will  be  capable  of 
learning  everything.  He  should  also  be  set  to  write 
aphorisms,  moral  essays  (chriae)  and  delineations  of  char- 
acter (ethologiae\}  of  which  the  teacher  will  first  give 
the  general  scheme,  since  such  themes  will  be  drawn 
from  their  reading.  In  all  of  these  exercises  the 
general  idea  is  the  same,  but  the  form  differs  : 
aphorisms  are  general  propositions,  while  elhologiae

alterum,  quod  est  in  respondendo,  hiterrogatus  ille, 
vel,  cum  hoc  ei  dictum  esset,  respondit ;  tertium  huic 
non  dissimile,  cum  quis  dirissct  all  quid,  vel  fecisset. 

6  Etiam  in  ipsorum  factis  esse  chriam  putant,  ut 
Crates,  cum  indoctum  puerum  vidisset,  paedagogum  eius 
percussit ;  et  aliud  paene  par  ei,  quod  tamen  eodem 
nomine  appellare  non  audent  sed  dicunt  xpetuiSes,  ut 
Milo,  quern  vitulum  assueverat  ferre,  taurum  ferebat. 
In  his  omnibus  et  declinatio  per  eosdem  ducitur 
casus,  et  tarn  factorum  quam  dictorum  ratio  est.

et  onera  et  modum  norunt.

sed  ut  maxime  necessaria ;  nunc  de  ceteris  artibus, 
quibus  instituendos,  priusquam  rlietori  tradantur,

are  concerned  with  persons.  Of  moral  essays  there  4 
are  various  forms  :  some  are  akin  to  aphorisms  and 
commence  with  a  simple  statement  "  he  said"  or  "he 
used  to  say  "  :  others  give  the  answer  to  a  question 
and  begin  "on  being  asked"  or  "in  answer  to  this 
he  replied/'  while  a  third  and  not  dissimilar  type 
begins,  "  when  someone  has  said  or  done  something." 
Some  hold  that  a  moral  essay  may  take  some  action  6 
as  its  text;  take  for  example  the  statement  "Crates 
on  seeing  an  ill-educated  boy,  beat  \\ispaedagogits,"  or 
a  very  similar  example  which  they  do  not  venture 
actually  to  propose  as  a  theme  for  a  moral  essay,  but 
content  themselves  with  saying  that  it  is  of  the 
nature  of  such  a  theme,  namely  "  Milo,  having 
accustomed  himself  to  carrying  a  calf  every  day, 
ended  by  carrying  it  when  grown  to  a  bull."  All 
these  instances  are  couched  in  the  same  gram- 
matical form  l  and  deeds  no  less  than  sayings  may 
be  presented  for  treatment.  Short  stories  from  the  6 
poets  should  in  my  opinion  be  handled  not  with 
a  view  to  style  but  as  a  means  of  increasing  know- 
ledge. Other  more  serious  and  ambitious  tasks 
have  been  also  imposed  on  teachers  of  literature  by 
the  fact  that  Latin  rhetoricians  will  have  nothing  to 
do  with  them  :  Greek  rhetoricians  have  a  better 
comprehension  of  the  extent  and  nature  of  the  tasks 
placed  on  their  shoulders. 

X.  I  have  made  my  remarks  011  this  stage  of 
education  as  brief  as  possible,  making  no  attempt  to 
say  everything,  (for  the  theme  is  infinite),  but  con- 
fining myself  to  the  most  necessary  points.  I  will 
now  proceed  briefly  to  discuss  the  remaining  arts  in 
which  I  think  boys  ought  to  be  instructed  before 
being  handed  over  to  the  teacher  of  rhetoric  :  for  it

is  by  such  studies  that  the  course  of  education  de- 
scribed by  the  Greeks  as  ey/cuVA-ios  TraiSeia  or  general 
education  will  be  brought  to  its  full  completion. 

For  there  are  other  subjects  of  education  which  2 
must  be  studied  simultaneously  with  literature. 
These  being  independent  studies  are  capable  of  com- 
pletion without  a  knowledge  of  oratory,  while  on  the 
other  hand  they  cannot  by  themselves  produce  an 
orator.  The  question  has  consequently  been  raised 
as  to  whether  they  are  necessary  for  this  purpose. 
What,  say  some,  has  the  knowledge  of  the  way  to  3 
describe  an  equilateral  triangle  on  a  given  straight 
line  got  to  do  with  pleading  in  the  law-courts  or 
speaking  in  the  senate  ?  Will  an  acquaintance  with 
the  names  and  intervals  of  the  notes  of  the  lyre  help 
an  orator  to  defend  a  criminal  or  direct  the  policy 
of  his  country?  They  will  perhaps  produce  a  long  4 
list  of  orators  who  are  most  effective  in  the  courts 
but  have  never  sat  under  a  geometrician  and  whose 
understanding  of  music  is  confined  to  the  pleasure 
which  their  ears,  like  those  of  other  men,  derive 
from  it.  To  such  critics  I  reply,  and  Cicero  frequently 
makes  the  same  remark  in  his  Orator,  that  I  am 
not  describing  any  orator  who  actually  exists  or  has 
existed,  but  have  in  my  mind's  eye  an  ideal  orator, 
perfect  down  to  the  smallest  detail.  For  when  the  5 
philosophers  describe  the  ideal  sage  who  is  to  be 
consummate  in  all  knowledge  and  a  very  god  incar- 
nate, as  they  say,  they  would  have  him  receive 
instruction  not  merely  in  the  knowledge  of  things 
human  and  divine,  but  would  also  lead  him  through 
a  course  of  subjects,  which  in  themselves  are  com- 
paratively trivial,  as  for  instance  the  elaborate 
subtleties  of  formal  logic  :  not  that  acquaintance

with  the  so  called  "  horn  "  l  or  "  crocodile  "  2  problems 
can  make  a  man  wise,  but  because  it  is  im- 
portant that  he  should  never  trip  even  in  the 
smallest  trifles.  So  too  the  teacher  of  geometry,  6 
music  or  other  subjects  which  I  would  class  with 
these,  will  not  be  able  to  create  the  perfect  orator 
(who  like  the  philosopher  ought  to  be  a  wise  man), 
but  none  the  less  these  arts  will  assist  in  his  perfec- 
tion. I  may  draw  a  parallel  from  the  use  of  antidotes 
and  other  remedies  applied  to  the  eyes  or  to  wounds. 
We  know  that  these  are  composed  of  ingredients 
which  produce  many  and  sometimes  contrary  effects, 
but  mixed  together  they  make  a  single  compound 
resembling  no  one  of  its  component  parts,  but 
deriving  its  peculiar  properties  from  all :  so  too  dumb  7 
insects  produce  honey,  whose  taste  is  beyond  the 
skill  of  man  to  imitate,  from  different  kinds  of  flowers 
and  juices.  Shall  we  marvel  then,  if  oratory,  the 
highest  gift  of  providence  to  man,  needs  the  assistance 
of  many  arts,  which,  although  they  do  not  reveal  or 
intrude  themselves  in  actual  speaking,  supply  hidden 
forces  and  make  their  silent  presence  felt  ?  "  But  '  8 
it  will  be  urged  "  men  have  proved  fluent  without 
their  aid."  Granted,  but  I  am  in  quest  of  an  orator. 
"•  Their  contribution  is  but  small."  Yes,  but  we  shall 
never  attain  completeness,  if  minor  details  be 
lacking.  And  it  will  be  agreed  that  though  our 
ideal  of  perfection  may  dwell  on  a  height  that  is  hard 
to  gain,  it  is  our  duty  to  teach  all  we  know,  that 
achievement  may  at  least  come  somewhat  nearer 
the  goal.  But  why  should  our  courage  fail  ?  The 
perfect  orator  is  not  contrary  to  the  laws  of  nature, 
and  it  is  cowardly  to  despair  of  anything  that  is 
within  the  bounds  of  possibility.

BOOK    I.  x.  9-12 

For  myself  I  should  be  ready  to  accept  the  verdict  9 
of  antiquity.  Who  is  ignorant  of  the  fact  that 
music,  of  which  I  will  speak  first,  was  in  ancient 
times  the  object  not  merely  of  intense  study  but  of 
veneration  :  in  fact  Orpheus  and  Linus,  to  mention 
no  others,  were  regarded  as  uniting  the  roles  of  musi- 
cian, poet  and  philosopher.  Both  were  of  divine 
origin,  while  the  former,  because  by  the  marvel  of 
his  music  he  soothed  the  savage  breast,  is  recorded 
to  have  drawn  after  him  not  merely  beasts  of  the 
wild,  but  rocks  and  trees.  So  too  Timagenes  10 
asserts  that  music  is  the  oldest  of  the  arts  related  to 
literature,  a  statement  which  is  confirmed  by  the  testi- 
mony of  the  greatest  of  poets  in  whose  songs  we  read 
that  the  praise  of  heroes  and  of  gods  were  sung  to 
the  music  of  the  lyre  at  the  feasts  of  kings.  Does  not 
lopas,  the  Vergilian  bard,  sing 

"  The  wandering  moon  and  labours  of  the  Sun  "  l 

and  the  like  ?  whereby  the  supreme  poet  mani- 
fests most  clearly  that  music  is  united  with  the 
knowledge  even  of  things  divine.  If  this  be  admit-  11 
ted,  music  will  be  a  necessity  even  for  an  orator, 
since  those  fields  of  knowledge,  which  were  annexed 
by  philosophy  on  their  abandonment  by  oratory, 
once  were  ours  and  without  the  knowledge  of  all 
such  things  there  can  be  no  perfect  eloquence. 
There  can  in  any  case  be  no  doubt  that  some  of  12 
those  men  whose  wisdom  is  a  household  word  have 
been  earnest  students  of  music :  Pythagoras  for 
instance  and  his  followers  popularised  the  belief, 
which  they  no  doubt  had  received  from  earlier 
teachers,  that  the  universe  is  constructed  on  the 
same  principles  which  were  afterwards  imitated  in

the  construction  of  the  lyre,  and  not  content  merely 
with  emphasising  that  concord  of  discordant  elements 
which  they  style  harmony  attributed  a  sound  to  the 
motions  of  the  celestial  bodies.1  As  for  Plato,  there  13 
are  certain  passages  in  his  works,  more  especially  in 
the  Timaeus?  which  are  quite  unintelligible  to  those 
who  have  not  studied  the  theory  of  music.  But 
why  speak  only  of  the  philosophers,  whose  master, 
Socrates,  did  not  blush  to  receive  instruction  in  play- 
in";  the  lyre  even  when  far  advanced  in  vears  ?  It  is  14 

o  J  J 

recorded  that  the  greatest  generals  played  on  the 
lyre  and  the  pipe,  and  that  the  armies  of  Sparta  were 
fired  to  martial  ardour  by  the  strains  of  music.  And 
what  else  is  the  function  of  the  horns  and  trumpets 
attached  to  our  legions  ?  The  louder  the  concert  of 
their  notes,  the  greater  is  the  glorious  supremacy  of 
our  arms  over  all  the  nations  of  the  earth.  It  was  15 
not  therefore  without  reason  that  Plato  regarded  the 
knowledge  of  music  as  necessary  to  his  ideal  states- 
man or  politician,  as  he  calls  him  ;  while  the  leaders 
even  of  that  school,  which  in  other  respects  is  the 
strictest  and  most  severe  of  all  schools  of  philosophy,3 
held  that  the  wise  man  might  well  devote  some  of 
his  attention  to  such  studies.  Lycurgus  himself,  the 
founder  of  the  stern  laws  of  Sparta,  approved  of  the 
training  supplied  by  music.  Indeed  nature  itself  16 
seems  to  have  given  music  as  a  boon  to  men  to  lighten 
the  strain  of  labour  :  even  the  rower  in  the  galleys 
is  cheered  to  effort  by  song.  Nor  is  this  function  of 
music  confined  to  cases  where  the  efforts  of  a  number 
are  given  union  by  the  sound  of  some  sweet  voice 
that  sets  the  tune,  but  even  solitary  workers  find 
solace  at  their  toil  in  artless  song.  So  far  I  have  17 
attempted  merely  to  sound  the  praises  of  the  noblest

of  arts  without  bringing  it  into  connexion  with  the 
education  of  an  orator.  1  will  therefore  pass  by  the 
fact  that  the  art  of  letters  and  that  of  music  were 
once  united  :  indeed  Archytas  and  Euenus  held 
that  the  former  was  subordinate  to  the  latter,  while 
we  know  that  the  same  instructors  were  employed 
for  the  teaching  of  both  from  Sophron,  a  writer  of 
farces,  it  is  true,  but  so  highly  esteemed  by  Plato, 
that  he  is  believed  to  have  had  Sophron's  works 
under  his  pillow  on  his  deathbed  :  the  same  fact  is  18 
proved  by  the  case  of  Eupolis,  who  makes  Prodamus 
teach  both  music  and  literature,  and  whose  Maricas, 
who  was  none  other  than  Hyperbolus  in  disguise, 
asserts  that  he  knows  nothing  of  music  but  letters. 
Aristophanes  l  again  in  more  than  one  of  his  plays 
shows  that  boys  were  trained  in  music  from  remote 
antiquity,  while  in  the  Hypobolimaeus  of  Menander 
an  old  man,  when  a  father  claims  his  son  from  him, 
gives  an  account  of  all  expenses  incurred  on  behalf 
of  the  boy's  education  and  states  that  he  has  paid 
out  large  sums  to  musicians  and  geometricians. 
From  the  importance  thus  given  to  music  also  origi-  19 
nated  the  custom  of  taking  a  lyre  round  the  company 
after  dinner,  and  when  on  such  an  occasion  Themis- 
tocles  confessed  that  he  could  not  play,  his  education 
was  (to  quote  the  words  of  Cicero)  "  regarded  as  im- 
perfect."2 Even  at  the  banquets  of  our  own  forefathers  20 
it  was  the  custom  to  introduce  the  pipe  and  lyre,  and 
even  the  hymn  of  the  Salii  has  its  tune.  These 
practices  were  instituted  by  King  Numa  and  clearly 
prove  that  not  even  those  whom  we  regard  as  rude 
warriors,  neglected  the  study  of  music,  at  least  in  so 
far  as  the  resources  of  that  age  allowed.  Finally  21 
there  was  actually  a  proverb  among  the  Greeks,

Numeros  musice  duplices  habet  in  vocibus  et  in

ad  gestum,  alterum  ad  collocationem  verborum, 
tertium  ad  flexus  vocis,  qui  sunt  in  agendo  quoque 

23  plurimi,  pertinet :  nisi  forte  in  carminibus  tantum  et 
in  canticis  exigitur   structura  quaedam   et  inoffensa

that  the  uneducated  were  far  from  the  company  of 
the    Muses    and    Graces.       But    let    us  discuss    the  22 
advantages  which  our  future  orator  may  reasonably 

C_j  •/  J 

expect  to  derive  from  the  study  of  Music. 

Music  has  two  modes  of  expression  in  the  voice 
and  in  the  body ; 1  for  both  voice  and  body  require 
to  be  controlled  by  appropriate  rules.  Aristoxenus 
divides  music,  in  so  far  as  it  concerns  the  voice,  into 
rhythm  and  melody,  the  one  consisting  in  measure, 
the  latter  in  sound  and  song.  Now  I  ask  you  whether 
it  is  not  absolutely  necessary  for  the  orator  to  be 
acquainted  with  all  these  methods  of  expression 
which  are  concerned  firstly  with  gesture,  secondly 
with  the  arrangement  of  words  and  thirdly  with  the 
inflexions  of  the  voice,  of  which  a  great  variety  are 
required  in  pleading.  Otherwise  we  must  assume  23 
that  structure  and  the  euphonious  combination  of 
sounds  are  necessary  only  for  poetry,  lyric  and  other- 
wise, but  superfluous  in  pleading,  or  that  unlike 
music,  oratory  has  no  interest  in  the  variation  of 
arrangement  and  sound  to  suit  the  demands  of  the 
case.  But  eloquence  does  vary  both  tone  and  rhythm,  24 
expressing  sublime  thoughts  with  elevation,  pleasing 
thoughts  with  sweetness,  and  ordinary  with  gentle 
utterance,  and  in  every  expression  of  its  art  is  in 
sympathy  with  the  emotions  of  which  it  is  the  mouth- 
piece. It  is  by  the  raising,  lowering  or  inflexion  of  25 
the  voice  that  the  orator  stirs  the  emotions  of  his 
hearers,  and  the  measure,  if  I  may  repeat  the  term, 
of  voice  or  phrase  differs  according  as  we  wish 
to  rouse  the  indignation  or  the  pity  of  the  judge. 
For,  as  we  know,  different  emotions  are  roused  even 
by  the  various  musical  instruments,  which  are 
incapable  of  reproducing  speech.  Further  the  26

motion  of  the  body  must  be  suitable  and  becoming, 
or  as  the  Greeks  call  it  eurythmic,  and  this  can  only 
be  secured  by  the  study  of  music.  This  is  a  most 
important  department  of  eloquence,  and  will  receive 
separate  treatment  in  this  work.1  To  proceed,  an  27 
orator  will  assuredly  pay  special  attention  to  his 
voice,  and  what  is  so  specially  the  concern  of  music 
as  this  ?  Here  too  I  must  not  anticipate  a  later 
section  of  this  work,  and  will  content  myself  by 
citing  the  example  of  Gaius  Gracchus,  the  leading 
orator  of  his  age,  who  during  his  speeches  had  a 
musician  standing  behind  him  with  a  pitchpipe,  or 
tonarion  as  the  Greeks  call  it,  whose  duty  it  was  to 
give  him  the  tones  in  which  his  voice  was  to  be 
pitched.  Such  was  the  attention  which  he  paid  to  28 
this  point  even  in  the  midst  of  his  most  turbulent 
speeches,  when  he  was  terrifying  the  patrician  party 
and  even  when  he  had  begun  to  fear  their  power. 
I  should  like  for  the  benefit  of  the  uninstructed, 
those  "  creatures  of  the  heavier  Muse,"  as  the  saying 
is,  to  remove  all  doubts  as  to  the  value  of  music. 
They  will  at  any  rate  admit  that  the  poets  should  be  29 
read  by  our  future  orator.  But  can  they  be  read 
without  some  knowledge  of  music?  Or  if  any  of 
my  critics  be  so  blind  as  to  have  some  doubts  about 
other  forms  of  poetry,  can  the  lyric  poets  at  any 
rate  be  read  without  such  knowledge?  If  there 
were  anything  novel  in  my  insistence  on  the  study 
of  music,  1  should  have  to  treat  the  matter  at 
greater  length.  But  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  30 
study  of  music  has,  from  those  remote  times  when 
Chiron  taught  Achilles  down  to  our  own  day,  con- 
tinued to  be  studied  by  all  except  those  who 
have  a  hatred  for  any  regular  course  of  study,  it

would  be  a  mistake  to  seem  to  cast  any  doubt  upon 
its  value  by  showing  an  excessive  zeal  in  its  defence. 
It  will,  however,  I  think  be  sufficiently  clear  from  31 
the  examples  I  have  already  quoted,  what  I  regard 
as  the  value  and  the  sphere  of  music  in  the  training 
of  an  orator.  Still  I  think  I  ought  to  be  more 
emphatic  than  I  have  been  in  stating  that  the  music 
which  I  desire  to  see  taught  is  not  our  modern  music, 
which  has  been  emasculated  by  the  lascivious  melo- 
dies of  our  effeminate  stage  and  has  to  no  small 
extent  destroyed  such  manly  vigour  as  we  still 
possessed.  No,  I  refer  to  the  music  of  old  which  was 
employed  to  sing  the  praises  of  brave  men  and  was 
sung  by  the  brave  themselves.  I  will  have  none 
of  your  psalteries  and  viols,  that  are  unfit  even  for 
the  use  of  a  modest  girl.  Give  me  the  knowledge 
of  the  principles  of  music,  which  have  power  to 
excite  or  assuage  the  emotions  of  mankind.  We  32 
are  told  that  Pythagoras  on  one  occasion,  when  some 
young  men  were  led  astray  by  their  passions  to 
commit  an  outrage  on  a  respectable  family,  calmed 
them  by  ordering  the  piper  to  change  her  strain  to  a 
spondaic  measure,  while  Chrysippus  selects  a  special 
tune  to  be  used  by  nurses  to  entice  their  little  charges 
to  sleep.  Further  I  may  point  out  that  among  the  33 
fictitious  themes  employed  in  declamation  is  one, 
doing  no  little  credit  to  its  author's  learning,  in 
which  it  is  supposed  that  a  piper  is  accused  of  man- 
slaughter because  he  had  played  a  tune  in  the  Phry- 
gian mode  as  an  accompaniment  to  a  sacrifice,  with 
the  result  that  the  person  officiating  went  mad  and 
flung  himself  over  a  precipice.  If  an  orator  is 
expected  to  declaim  on  such  a  theme  as  this,  which 
cannot  possibly  be  handled  without  some  knowledge

of  music,  how  can  my  critics  for  all  their  prejudice 
fail  to  agree  that  music  is  a  necessary  element  in 
the  education  of  an  orator  ? 

As  regards  geometry/  it  is  granted  that  portions  of  34 
this  science  are  of  value  for  the  instruction  of  children: 
for  admittedly  it  exercises  their  minds,  sharpens 
their  wits  and  generates  quickness  of  perception. 
But  it  is  considered  that  the  value  of  geometry 
resides  in  the  process  of  learning,  and  not  as  with 
other  sciences  in  the  knowledge  thus  acquired. 
Such  is  the  general  opinion.  But  it  is  not  without  35 
good  reason  that  some  of  the  greatest  men  have 
devoted  special  attention  to  this  science.  Geometry 
has  two  divisions ;  one  is  concerned  with  numbers, 
the  other  with  figures.  Now  knowledge  of  the  former 
is  a  necessity  not  merely  to  the  orator,  but  to  any 
one  who  has  had  even  an  elementary  education. 
Such  knowledge  is  frequently  required  in  actual 
cases,  in  which  a  speaker  is  regarded  as  de- 
ficient in  education,  I  will  not  say  if  he  hesitates 
in  making  a  calculation,  but  even  if  he  contradicts 
the  calculation  which  he  states  in  words  by  making 
an  uncertain  or  inappropriate  gesture  with  his  fingers.2 
Again  linear  geometry  is  frequently  required  in  36 
cases,  as  in  lawsuits  about  boundaries  and  measure- 
ments. But  geometry  and  oratory  are  related  in  a 
yet  more  important  way  than  this.  In  the  first  37 
place  logical  development  is  one  of  the  necessities 
of  geometry.  And  is  it  not  equally  a  necessity  for 
oratory  ?  Geometry  arrives  at  its  conclusions  from 
definite  premises,  and  by  arguing  from  what  is  certain 
proves  what  was  previously  uncertain.  Is  not  this 
just  what  we  do  in  speaking  ?  Again  are  not  the 
problems  of  geometry  almost  entirely  solved  by  the

syllogistic  method,  a  fact  which  makes  the  majority 
assert  that  geometry  bears  a  closer  resemblance  to 
logic  than  to  rhetoric  ?  But  even  the  orator  will 
sometimes,  though  rarely,  prove  his  point  by  formal 
logic.  For,  if  necessary,  he  will  use  the  syllogism,  38 
and  he  will  certainly  make  use  of  the  enthymeme 
which  is  a  rhetorical  form  of  syllogism.1  Further 
the  most  absolute  form  of  proof  is  that  which  is 
generally  known  as  linear  demonstration.  And  what 
is  the  aim  of  oratory  if  not  proof?  Again  oratory  39 
sometimes  detects  falsehoods  closely  resembling  the 
truth  by  the  use  of  geometrical  methods.  An 
example  of  this  may  be  found  in  connexion  with 
numbers  in  the  so-called  pseudographs,  a  favourite 
amusement  in  our  boyhood.2  But  there  are  more 
important  points  to  be  considered.  Who  is  there 
who  would  not  accept  the  following  proposition  ? 
"  When  the  lines  bounding  two  figures  are  equal  in 
length,  the  areas  contained  within  those  lines  are 
equal."  But  this  is  false,  for  everything  depends  on  40 
the  shape  of  the  figure  formed  by  these  lines,  and 
historians  have  been  taken  to  task  by  geometricians 
for  believing  the  time  taken  to  circumnavigate  an 
island  to  be  a  sufficient  indication  of  its  size.  For 
the  space  enclosed  is  in  proportion  to  the  perfection 
of  the  figure.  Consequently  if  the  bounding  line  41 
to  which  we  have  referred  form  a  circle,  the  most 
perfect  of  all  plane  figures,  it  will  contain  a  greater 
space  than  if  the  same  length  of  line  took  the  form 
of  a  square,  while  a  square  contains  a  greater  space 
than  a  triangle  having  the  same  total  perimeter,  and 
an  equilateral  triangle  than  a  scalene  triangle.  But  42 
there  are  other  points  which  perhaps  present  greater

difficulty.  I  will  take  an  example  which  is  easy 
even  for  those  who  have  no  knowledge  of  geometry. 
There  is  scarcely  anyone  who  does  not  know  that 
the  Roman  acre  is  240  feet  long  and  120  feet 
broad,  and  its  total  perimeter  and  the  area  enclosed 
can  easily  be  calculated.  But  a  square  of  180  feet  43 
gives  the  same  perimeter,  yet  contains  a  much 
larger  area  within  its  four  sides.  If  the  calculation 
prove  irksome  to  any  of  my  readers,  he  can  learn  the 
same  truth  by  employing  smaller  numbers.  Take  a 
ten  foot  square :  its  perimeter  is  forty  feet  and  it 
contains  100  square  feet.  But  if  the  dimensions  be 
fifteen  feet  by  five,  while  the  perimeter  is  the  same, 
the  area  enclosed  is  less  by  a  quarter.  On  the  other  44 
hand  if  we  draw  a  parallelogram  measuring  nineteen 
feet  by  one,  the  number  of  square  feet  enclosed  will 
be  no  greater  than  the  number  of  linear  feet  making 
the  actual  length  of  the  parallelogram,  though  the 
perimeter  will  be  exactly  as  that  of  the  figure  which 
encloses  an  area  of  100  square  feet.  Consequently  the 
area  enclosed  by  four  lines  will  decrease  in  proportion 
as  we  depart  from  the  form  of  a  square.  It  further  45 
follows  that  it  is  perfectly  possible  for  the  space 
enclosed  to  be  less,  though  the  perimeter  be  greater. 
This  applies  to  plane  figures  only :  for  even  one  who 
is  no  mathematician  can  see  that,  when  we  have  to 
consider  hills  or  valleys,  the  extent  of  ground  enclosed 
is  greater  than  the  sky  over  it.  But  geometry  soars  46 
still  higher  to  the  consideration  of  the  system  of 
the  universe  :  for  by  its  calculations  it  demonstrates 
the  fixed  and  ordained  courses  of  the  stars,  and 
thereby  we  acquire  the  knowledge  that  all  things 
are  ruled  by  order  and  destiny,  a  consideration 
which  may  at  times  be  of  value  to  an  orator.  When  47

Pericles  dispelled  the  panic  caused  at  Athens  by  the 
eclipse  of  the  sun  by  explaining  the  causes  of  the 
phenomenon,  or  Sulpicius  Gallus  discoursed  on  the 
eclipse  of  the  moon  to  the  army  of  Lucius  Paulus  to 
prevent  the  soldiers  being  seized  with  terror  at  what 
they  regarded  as  a  portent  sent  by  heaven,  did  not 
they  discharge  the  function  of  an  orator?  If  Nicias  48 
had  known  this  when  he  commanded  in  Sicilv,  he 

v   •* 

would  not  have  shared  the  terror  of  his  men  nor  lost 
the  finest  army  that  Athens  ever  placed  in  the  field. 
Dion  for  instance  when  he  came  to  Syracuse  to  over- 
throw the  tyranny  of  Dionysius,  was  not  frightened 
away  by  the  occurrence  of  a  similar  phenomenon. 
However  we  are  not  concerned  with  the  uses  of 
geometry  in  war  and  need  not  dwell  upon  the  fact 
that  Archimedes  singlehanded  succeeded  in  appreci- 
ably prolonging  the  resistance  of  Syracuse  when  it 
was  besieged.  It  will  suffice  for  our  purpose  that  49 
there  are  a  number  of  problems  which  it  is  difficult 
to  solve  in  any  other  way,  which  are  as  a  rule  solved 
by  these  linear  demonstrations,  such  as  the  method 
of  division,  section  to  infinity,1  and  the  ratio  of  in- 
crease in  velocity.  From  this  we  may  conclude  that, 
if  as  we  shall  show  in  the  next  book  an  orator  has 
to  speak  on  every  kind  of  subject,  he  can  under 
no  circumstances  dispense  \vith  a  knowledge  of 
geometry.

amount  of  our  attention,  but  only  in  so  far  as  our

For  I  do  not  of  course  wish  the  boy,  whom  we  are 
training  to  this  end,  to  talk  with  the  shrillness  of  a 
woman  or  in  the  tremulous  accents  of  old  age.  Nor  2 
for  that  matter  must  he  ape  the  vices  of  the

is  still  pliable  and  unformed.  For  repeated  imita-  3 
tion  passes  into  habit.  Nor  yet  again  must  we 
adopt  all  the  gestures  and  movements  of  the  actor. 
Within  certain  limits  the  orator  must  be  a  master  of 
both,  but  he  must  rigorously  avoid  staginess  and  all 
extravagance  of  facial  expression,  gesture  and  gait. 
For  if  an  orator  does  command  a  certain  art  in  such 
matters,  its  highest  expression  will  be  in  the  con- 
cealment of  its  existence. 

What  then  is  the  duty  of  the  teacher  whom  4 
we  have  borrowed  from  the  stage  ?  In  the 
first  place  he  must  correct  all  faults  of  pro- 
nunciation, and  see  that  the  utterance  is  distinct, 
and  that  each  letter  has  its  proper  sound. 
There  is  an  unfortunate  tendency  in  the  case  of 
some  letters  to  pronounce  them  either  too  thinly 
or  too  fullv,  while  some  we  find  too  harsh  and  fail  to 

J  ' 

pronounce    sufficiently,    substituting    others    whose 
sound  is  similar  but  somewhat  duller.     For  instance,  5 
lambda  is  substituted    for    rho,  a    letter  which    was 
always   a    stumbling-block  to    Demosthenes ;    our  / 
and    r  have  of   course  the   same   value.1     Similarly 
when  c  and  g  are  not  given  their  full  value,  they 
are  softened  into  t  and  d.     Again  our  teacher  must  6 
not  tolerate  the  affected  pronunciation  of  s 2   with 
which   we    are    painfully  familiar,  nor   suffer   words 
to    be    uttered    from    the    depths    of  the  throat  or 

2  Quintilian  perhaps  alludes  to  the  habit  of  prefixing  t  to 
initial  st,  sp,  sc  found  in  inscriptions  of  the  later  Empire.

rolled  out  hollow-mouthed,  or  permit  the  natural 
sound  of  the  voice  to  be  over-laid  with  a  fuller 
sound,  a  fault  fatal  to  purity  of  speech ;  the 
Greeks  give  this  peculiarity  the  name  KaraTre- 
rrA.acr/xeVov  (plastered  over),  a  term  applied  to  the  7 
tone  produced  by  a  pipe,  when  the  stops  which 
produce  the  treble  notes  are  closed,  and  a  bass  note 
is  produced  through  the  main  aperture  only.  He  8 
will  also  see  that  final  syllables  are  not  clipped,  that 
the  quality  of  speech  is  continuously  maintained, 
that  when  the  voice  is  raised,  the  strain  falls  upon 
the  lungs  and  not  the  mouth,  and  that  gesture  and 
voice  are  mutually  appropriate.  He  will  also  insist  9 
that  the  speaker  faces  his  audience,  that  the  lips 
are  not  distorted  nor  the  jaws  parted  to  a  grin, 
that  the  face  is  not  thrown  back,  nor  the  eyes  fixed 
on  the  ground,  nor  the  neck  slanted  to  left  or  right. 
For  there  are  a  variety  of  faults  of  facial  expression. 
I  have  seen  many,  who  raised  their  brows  whenever  10 
the  voice  was  called  upon  for  an  effort,  others  who 
wore  a  perpetual  frown,  and  yet  others  who  could 
not  keep  their  eyebrows  level,  but  raised  one 
towards  the  top  of  the  head  and  depressed  the 
other  till  it  almost  closed  the  eye.  These  are  11 
details,  but  as  I  shall  shortly  show,  they  are  of 
enormous  importance,  for  nothing  that  is  unbecoming 
can  have  a  pleasing  effect. 

Our  actor  will  also  be  required  to  show  how  a  12 
narrative  should  be  delivered,  and  to  indicate  the 
authoritative  tone  that  should  be  given  to  advice, 
the  excitement  which  should  mark  the  rise  of  anger, 
and  the  change  of  tone  that  is  characteristic  of 
pathos.  The  best  method  of  so  doing  is  to  select 
special  passages  from  comedy  appropriate  for  the

the  time  has  come  for  him  to  read  speeches,  and  as 
soon  as  he  begins  to  appreciate  their  merits,  he 
should  have  a  careful  and  efficient  teacher  at  his 
side  not  merely  to  form  his  style  of  reading  aloud, 
but  to  make  him  learn  select  passages  by  heart  and 
declaim  them  standing  in  the  manner  which  actual 
pleading  would  require  :  thus  he  will  simultaneously 
train  delivery,  voice  and  memory.

I  will  not  blame  even  those  who  give  a  certain  15 
amount  of  time  to  the  teacher  of  gymnastics.  I  am 
not  speaking  of  those,  who  spend  part  of  their  life 
in  rubbing  themselves  with  oil  and  part  in  wine- 
bibbing,  and  kill  the  mind  by  over-attention  to  the 
body :  indeed,  I  would  have  such  as  these  kept 
as  far  a£  possible  from  the  boy  whom  we  are 
training.  But  we  give  the  same  name  to  those  who  16 
form  gesture  and  motion  so  that  the  arms  may  be 
extended  in  the  proper  manner,  the  management  of 
the  hands  free  from  all  trace  of  rusticity  and 
inelegance,  the  attitude  becoming,  the  movements 
of  the  feet  appropriate  and  the  motions  of  the  head 
and  eyes  in  keeping  with  the  poise  of  the  body.  No  17 
one  will  deny  that  such  details  form  a  part  of  the 
art  of  delivery,  nor  divorce  delivery  from  oratory  ; 
and  there  can  be  no  justification  for  disdaining  to 
learn  what  has  got  to  be  done,  especially  as

approval  of  the  greatest  Greeks,  not  excepting 
Socrates  himself,  while  it  was  placed  by  Plato  among 
the  virtues  of  a  citizen  and  included  by  Chrysippus 
in  his  instructions  relative  to  the  education  of 
children.  We  are  told  that  the  Spartans  even  18 
regarded  a  certain  form  of  dance  as  a  useful 
element  in  military  training.  Nor  again  did  the 
ancient  Romans  consider  such  a  practice  as  disgrace- 
ful :  this  is  clear  from  the  fact  that  priestly  and 
ritual  dances  have  survived  to  the  present  day,  while 
Cicero  in  the  third  book  of  his  de  Oralore1  quotes  the 
words  of  Crassus,  in  which  he  lays  down  the 
principle  that  the  orator  "should  learn  to  move  his 
body  in  a  bold  and  manly  fashion  derived  not  from 
actors  or  the  stage,  but  from  martial  and  even  from 
gymnastic  exercises."  And  such  a  method  of  train- 
ing has  persisted  uncensured  to  our  own  time.  In  my  19 
opinion,  however,  such  training  should  not  extend 
beyond  the  years  of  boyhood,  and  even  boys  should 
not  devote  too  much  time  to  it.  For  I  do  not  wish 
the  gestures  of  oratory  to  be  modelled  on  those 
of  the  dance.  But  I  do  desire  that  such  boyish 
exercises  should  continue  to  exert  a  certain  influ- 
ence, and  that  something  of  the  grace  which  we 
acquired  as  learners  should  attend  us  in  after  life 
without  our  being  conscious  of  the  fact. 

XII.  The  question  is  not  infrequently  asked,  as 
to  whether,  admitting  that  these  things  ought  to 
be  learned,  it  is  possible  for  all  of  them  to  be 
taught  and  taken  in  simultaneously.  There  are 
some  who  say  that  this  is  impossible  on  the  ground 
that  the  mind  is  confused  and  tired  by  application 
to  so  many  studies  of  different  tendencies  :  neither 
the  intelligence  nor  the  physique  of  our  pupils,  nor

the  time  at  our  disposal  are  sufficient,  they  say,  and 
even  though  older  boys  may  be  strong  enough,  it  is 
a  sin  to  put  such  a  burden  on  the  shoulders  of  child- 
hood. These  critics  show  an  insufficient  appre-  2 
ciation  of  the  capacities  of  the  human  mind,  which 
is  so  swift  and  nimble  and  versatile,  that  it  cannot 
be  restricted  to  doing  one  thing  only,  but  insists  on 
devoting  its  attention  to  several  different  subjects  not 
merely  in  one  day,  but  actually  at  one  and  the 
same  time.  Do  not  harpists  simultaneously  exert  3 
the  memory  and  pay  attention  to  the  tone  and 
inflexions  of  the  voice,  while  the  right  hand  runs 
over  certain  strings  and  the  left  plucks,  stops  or 
releases  others,  and  even  the  foot  is  employed  in 
beating  time,  all  these  actions  being  performed  at 
the  same  moment?  Again,  do  not  we  ourselves,  4 
when  unexpectedly  called  upon  to  plead,  speak 
while  we  are  thinking  what  we  are  to  say  next, 
invention  of  argument,  choice  of  words,  rhythm, 
gesture,  delivery,  facial  expression  and  movement  all 
being  required  simultaneously?  Jf  all  these  things 
can  be  done  with  one  effort  in  spite  of  their 
diversity,  why  should  we  not  divide  our  hours  among 
different  branches  of  study  ?  We  must  remember 
that  variety  serves  to  refresh  and  restore  the  mind, 
and  that  it  is  really  considerably  harder  to  work  at 
one  subject  without  intermission.  Consequently  we 
should  give  the  pen  a  rest  by  turning  to  read,  and 
relieve  the  tedium  of  reading  by  changes  of  subject. 
However  manifold  our  activities,  in  a  certain  sense  5 
we  come  fresh  to  each  new  subject.  Who  can 
maintain  his  attention,  if  he  has  to  listen  for  a 
whole  day  to  one  teacher  harping  on  the  same 
subject,  be  it  what  it  may?  Change  of  studies  is

like  change  of  foods:  the  stomach  is  refreshed  by 
their  variety  and  derives  greater  nourishment  from 
variety  of  viands.  If  my  critics  disagree,  let  them  6 
provide  me  with  an  alternative  method.  Are  we 
first  to  deliver  ourselves  up  to  the  sole  service  of 
the  teacher  of  literature,  and  then  similarly  to  the 
teacher  of  geometry,  neglecting  under  the  latter 
what  was  taught  us  by  the  former  ?  And  then  are 
we  to  go  on  to  the  musician,  forgetting  all  that  we 
learned  before  ?  And  when  we  study  Latin  litera- 
ture, are  we  to  do  so  to  the  exclusion  of  Greek  ?  In 
fine,  to  have  done  with  the  matter  once  and  for  all, 
are  we  to  do  nothing  except  that  which  last  comes 
to  our  hand?  On  this  principle,  why  not  advise  7 
farmers  not  to  cultivate  corn,  vines,  olives  and 
orchard  trees  at  the  same  time  ?  or  from  devoting 
themselves  simultaneously  to  pastures,  cattle,  gar- 
dens, bees  and  poultry?  Why  do  we  ourselves  daily 
allot  some  of  our  time  to  the  business  of  the  courts, 
some  to  the  demands  of  our  friends,  some  to  our 
domestic  affairs,  some  to  the  exercise  of  the  body, 
and  some  even  to  our  pleasures  ?  Any  one  of  these 
occupations,  if  pursued  without  interruption,  would 
fatigue  us.  So  much  easier  is  it  to  do  many  things 
than  to  do  one  thing  for  a  long  time  continuously. 

We  need  have  no  fear  at  any  rate  that  boys  will  8 
find  their  work  too  exhausting:  there  is  no  age  more 
capable  of  enduring  fatigue.     The  fact  may  be  sur- 
prising, but  it  can  be  proved    by   experiment.      For 
the  mind  is  all  the  easier  to  teach  before  it  is  set.  This  9 
may  be  clearly  proved  by  the  fact  that  within  two 
years  after  a  child  has  begun  to  form  words  correctly, 
he  can  speak   practically  all  without    any    pressure 
from  outside.     On  the  other  hand  how  many  years

quam    iuvenibus.      Videlicet,   ut    corpora   infantium

graviter  adfligit  nee  ilia  per  manus  et  genua  reptatio

conatu  moventur  nee  suo  nisu  studiis  insistunt,  sed 
formandos  se   tantummodo   praestant,  non   similiter 

11  fatigantur.      Praeterea  secundum  aliam  aetatis  illius 
facilitatem  velut  simplicius  docenles  sequuntur  nee 
quae    iam    egerint    metiuntur.      Abest    illis    adhuc

it  takes  for  our  newly-imported  slaves  to  become 
familiar  with  the  Latin  language.  Try  to  teach  an 
adult  to  read  and  you  will  soon  appreciate  the  force 
of  the  saying  applied  to  those  who  do  everything 
connected  with  their  art  with  the  utmost  skill  "  he 
started  young  ! '  Moreover  boys  stand  the  strain  of  10 
work  better  than  young  men.  Just  as  small  children 
suffer  less  damage  from  their  frequent  falls,  from 
their  crawling  on  hands  and  knees  and,  a  little  later, 
from  their  incessant  play  and  their  running  about 
from  morn  till  eve,  because  they  are  so  light  in 
weight  and  have  so  little  to  carry,  even  so  their 
minds  are  less  susceptible  of  fatigue,  because  their 
activity  calls  for  less  effort  and  application  to  study 
demands  no  exertion  of  their  own,  since  they  are 
merely  so  much  plastic  material  to  be  moulded  by 
the  teacher.  And  further  owing  to  the  general  11 
pliability  of  childhood,  they  follow  their  instructors 
with  greater  simplicity  and  without  attempting  to 
measure  their  own  progress :  for  as  yet  they  do  not 
even  appreciate  the  nature  of  their  work.  Finally,  as 
I  have  often  noticed,  the  senses  are  less  affected  by 
mere  hard  work  than  they  are  by  hard  thinking. 

Moreover  there  will  never  be  more  time  for  such  12 
studies,  since  at  this  age  all  progress  is  made  through 
listening  to  the  teacher.  Later  when  the  boy  has  to 
write  by  himself,  or  to  produce  and  compose  some- 
thing out  of  his  own  head, he  will  neither  have  the  time 
nor  the  inclination  for  the  exercises  which  we  have 
been  discussing.  Since,  then,  the  teacher  ofliterature  13 
neither  can  nor  ought  to  occupy  the  whole  day,  for 
fear  of  giving  his  pupil  a  distaste  for  work,  what  are 
the  studies  to  which  the  spare  time  should  preferably 
be  devoted  ?  For  I  do  not  wish  the  student  to  wear  14

himself  out  in  such  pursuits :  I  would  not  have  him  sing 
or  learn  to  read  music  or  dive  deep  into  the  minuter 
details  of  geometry,,  nor  need  he  be  a  finished  actor  in 
his  delivery  or  a  dancer  in  his  gesture  :    if  I  did  de- 
mand all  these  accomplishments,,  there  would  yet  be 
time  for  them  ;    the  period  allotted  to  education  is 
longhand  I  am  not  speaking  of  duller  wits.      Why  did  16 
Plato  bear  away  the  palm  in  all  these  branches  of 
knowledge  which  in  my  opinion  the  future   orator 
should  learn?  I  answer,  because  he  was  not  merely  con- 
tent with  the  teaching  which  Athens  was  able  to  pro- 
vide or  even  with  that  of  the  Pythagoreans  whom  he 
visited  in   Italy,  but  even  approached  the  priests  of 
Egypt  and  made  himself  thoroughly  acquainted  with 
all  their  secret  lore. 

The  plea   of   the  difficulty  of  the  subject  is  put  16 
forward  merely  to  cloak  our  indolence,  because  we 
do  not  love  the  work  that  lies  before  us  nor  seek  to 
win  eloquence  for  our  own  because  it  is  a  noble  art 
and  the  fairest  thing  in  all  the  world,  but  gird  up 
our  loins  for  mercenary  ends  and  for  the  winning  of 
filthy  lucre.  Without  such  accomplishments  many  may  17 
speak  in  the  courts  and  make  an  income  ;  but  it  is 
my  prayer  that  every  dealer  in  the  vilest  merchandise 
may  be  richer  than  they  and  that  the  public  crier 
may  find  his  voice  a  more  lucrative  possession.     And 
I  trust  that  there  is  not  one  even  among  my  readers 
who  would  think  of  calculating  the  monetary  value 
of    such    studies.     But  he  that  has  enough  of  the   18 
divine  spark  to  conceive  the  ideal  eloquence,  he  who, 
as  the  great  tragic  poet l  says,  regards  "  oratory  "  as 
"the  queen  of  all  the  world"  and  seeks  not  the  transi- 
tory gains  of  advocacy,  but  those  stable  and  lasting 
rewards  which   his    own    soul    and    knowledge    and

self to  spend  his  time  not,  like  so  many,  in  the  theatre

to  say  naught  of  the  hours  that  are  wasted  in  sleep

is  yet  too  young  to  proceed  to  greater  things  !  My 
next  book  will  start  afresh  and  will  pass  to  the  con-

I.  TENUIT  consuetude,  quae  cotidie  magis  inva-

quam  ratio  postulat,  traderentur.  Eius  rei  duplex 
causa  est,  quod  et  rhetores  utique  nostri  suas  partes 
omiserunt  et  grammatici  alienas  occupaverunt. 

2  Nam  et  illi  declamare  modo  et  scientiam  declamandi

deliberativas  iudicialesque  materias  (nam  cetera   ut

credunt  excepisse,  quae  relicta  erant,  (quo  nomine 
gratia  quoque  iis  babenda  est),  sed  ad  prosopopoeias 
usque    ac    suasorias,    in    quibus    onus    dicendi    vel 

3  maximum    est,   irrumpunt.      Hinc    ergo    accidit,   ut, 
quae    alterius    artis    prima    erant    opera,    facta    sint 
alterius  novissima,  et  aetas  altioribus  iam  disciplinis 
debita  in  schola  minore  subsidat  ac  rhetoricen  apud 
grammaticos  exerceat.      Ita,  quod  est  maxime  ridi- 
culum,  non  ante  ad  declamandi  magistrum  mittendus 
videtur  puer  quam  declamare  sciat.

Hannibal  deliberates  whether  he  should  cross  the  Alps).

BOOK    II 

I.  THE  custom  has  prevailed  arid  is  daily  growing 
commoner  of  sending  boys  to  the  schools  of  rhetoric 
much   later   than  is  reasonable  :    this  is  always  the 
case    as    regards     Latin    rhetoric     and     occasionally 
applies  to   Greek   as  well.     The  reason  for  this   is 
twofold :  the  rhetoricians,  more  especially  our  own, 
have    abandoned    certain    of    their    duties    and  the 
teachers  of  literature  have  undertaken  tasks  which 
rightly  belong  to  others.     For  the  rhetorician  con-  2 
siders  that  his  duty  is  merely  to  declaim  and  give 
instruction  in  the  theory  and  practice  of  declamation 
and  confines  his  activities  to  deliberative  and  judicial 
themes,  regarding  all  others  as  beneath  the  dignity 
of  his  profession  ;  while  the  teacher  of  literature  is 
not  satisfied  to  take  what  is  left  him  (and  we  owe 
him  a  debt  of  gratitude  for  this),  but  even  presumes 
to  handle  declamations  in  character  and  deliberative 
themes,1  tasks  which  impose  the  very  heaviest  burden 
on  the  speaker.     Consequently  subjects  which  once  3 
formed  the  first   stages    of    rhetoric    have   come  to 
form    the    final  stages  of  a    literary  education,  and 
boys  who  are  ripe  for  more  advanced  study  are  kept 
back   in  the  inferior    school    and    practise    rhetoric 
under  the  direction  of  teachers  of  literature.     Thus 
we  get  the  absurd  result  that  a  boy  is  not  regarded 
as  fit  to  go  on  to  the  schools  of  declamation  till  he 
knows  how  to  declaim.

BOOK    II.  i.  4-8 

The  two  professions  must  each  be  assigned  their  4 
proper  sphere.  Grammatice,  which  we  translate  as 
the  science  of  letters,  must  learn  to  know  its  own 
limits,  especially  as  it  has  encroached  so  far  beyond 
the  boundaries  to  which  its  unpretentious  name 
should  restrict  it  and  to  which  its  earlier  professors 
actually  confined  themselves.  Springing  from  a  tiny 
fountain-head,  it  has  gathered  strength  from  the 
historians  and  critics  and  has  swollen  to  the  dimen- 
sions of  a  brimming  river,  since,  not  content  with  the 
theory  of  correct  speech,  no  inconsiderable  subject, 
it  has  usurped  the  study  of  practically  all  the  highest 
departments  of  knowledge.  On  the  other  hand  5 
rhetoric,  which  derives  its  name  from  the  power  of 
eloquence,  must  not  shirk  its  peculiar  duties  nor  re- 
joice to  see  its  own  burdens  shouldered  by  others. 
For  the  neglect  of  these  is  little  less  than  a  surrender 
of  its  birthright.  I  will  of  course  admit  that  there  G 
may  be  a  few  professors  of  literature  who  have 
acquired  sufficient  knowledge  to  be  able  to  teach  rhe- 
toric as  well  ;  but  when  they  do  so,  they  are  perform- 
ing the  duties  of  the  rhetorician,  not  their  own. 

A  further  point  into  which  we  must  enquire  con-  ' 
cerns  the  age  at  which  a  boy  may  be  considered 
sufficiently  advanced  to  profit  by  the  instructions  of 
the  rhetorician.  In  this  connexion  we  must  consider 
not  the  boy's  actual  age,  but  the  progress  he  has 
made  in  his  studies.  To  put  it  briefly,  I  hold  that 
the  best  answer  to  the  question  "  When  should  a 
boy  be  sent  to  the  school  of  rhetoric  ? "  is  this, 
"  When  he  is  fit."  But  this  question  is  really  depen-  8 
dent  on  that  previously  raised.  For  if  the  duties  of 
the  teacher  of  literature  are  prolonged  to  include 
instruction  in  deliberative  declamation,  this  will

postpone  the  need  for  the  rhetorician.  On  the  other 
hand  if  the  rhetorician  does  not  refuse  to  undertake 
the  first  duties  of  his  task,  his  instruction  will  be  re- 
quired from  the  moment  the  boy  begins  to  compose 
narratives  and  his  first  attempts  at  passages  of  praise 
or  denunciation.  We  know  that  the  orators  of  9 
earlier  days  improved  their  eloquence  by  declaiming 
themes  and  common-places l  and  other  forms  of 
rhetorical  exercises  not  involving  particular  circum- 
stances or  persons  such  as  provide  the  material  for 
real  or  imaginary  causes.2  From  this  we  can  clearly 
see  what  a  scandalous  dereliction  of  duty  it  is  for 
the  schools  of  rhetoric  to  abandon  this  department 
of  their  work,  which  was  not  merely  its  first,  but 
for  a  long  time  its  sole  task.  What  is  there  in  10 
those  exercises  of  which  I  have  just  spoken  that 
does  not  involve  matters  which  are  the  special  con- 
cern of  rhetoric  and  further  are  typical  of  actual 
legal  cases  ?  Have  we  not  to  narrate  facts  in 
the  law-courts  ?  Indeed  I  am  not  sure  that  this  is 
not  the  most  important  department  of  rhetoric  in 
actual  practice.  Are  not  eulogy  and  denunciation  11 
frequently  introduced  in  the  course  of  the  contests 
of  the  courts  ?  Are  not  common-places  frequently 
inserted  in  the  very  heart  of  lawsuits,  whether,  like 
those  which  we  find  in  the  works  of  Cicero,  they  are 
directed  against  vice,  or,  like  those  published  by 
Quintus  Hortensius,  deal  with  questions  of  general 
interest  such  as  "whether  small  points  of  argu- 
ment should  carry  weight,"  or  are  employed  to 
defend  or  impugn  the  credibility  of  witnesses  ? 
These  are  weapons  which  we  should  always  have  1£ 
stored  in  our  armoury  ready  for  immediate  use  as 
occasion  may  demand.  The  critic  who  denies  that

such  matters  concern  an  orator  is  one  who  will 
refuse  to  believe  that  a  statue  is  being  begun 
when  its  limbs  are  actually  being  cast.  Some  will 
think  that  I  am  in  too  great  a  hurry,  but  let  no  one 
accuse  me  of  thinking  that  the  pupil  who  has  been 
entrusted  to  the  rhetorician  should  forthwith  be 
withdrawn  from  the  teacher  of  literature.  The  latter  13 
will  still  have  certain  hours  allotted  him,  and  there 
is  no  reason  to  fear  that  a  bov  will  be  overloaded  by 
receiving  instruction  from  two  different  masters.  It 
will  not  mean  any  increase  of  work,  but  merely  the 
division  among  two  masters  of  the  studies  which 
were  previously  indiscriminately  combined  under  one  : 
and  the  efficiency  of  either  teacher  will  be  increased. 
This  method  is  still  in  vogue  among  the  Greeks,  but 
has  been  abandoned  by  us,  not  perhaps  without  some 
excuse,  as  there  were  others  ready  to  step  into  the 
rhetorician's  shoes. 

II.  As  soon  therefore  as  a  boy  has  made  sufficient 
progress  in  his  studies  to  be  able  to  follow  what  I 
have  styled  the  first  stage  of  instruction  in  rhetoric, 
he  should  be  placed  under  a  rhetorician.  Our  first 
task  must  be  to  enquire  whether  the  teacher  is  of 
good  character.  The  reason  which  leads  me  to  deal  2 
with  this  subject  in  this  portion  of  my  work  is  not 
that  I  regard  character  as  a  matter  of  indifference 
where  other  teachers  are  concerned,  (I  have  already 
shown  how  important  I  think  it  in  the  preceding 
book),  but  that  the  age  to  which  the  pupil  has  now 
attained  makes  the  mention  of  this  point  especially 
necessary.  For  as  a  rule  boys  are  on  the  verge  of  3 
manhood  when  transferred  to  the  teacher  of  rhetoric 
and  continue  with  him  even  when  they  are  young 
men :  consequently  we  must  spare  no  effort  to  secure

that  the  purity  of  the  teacher's  character  should 
preserve  those  of  tenderer  years  from  corruption, 
while  its  authority  should  keep  the  bolder  spirits 
from  breaking  out  into  licence.  Nor  is  it  sufficient  4

that  he  should  merely  set  an  example  of  the  highest 
personal  self-control ;  he  must  also  be  able  to  govern 
the  behaviour  of  his  pupils  by  the  strictness  of  his 
discipline. 

Let  him  therefore  adopt  a  parental  attitude  to  his  5 
pupils,  and  regard  himself  as  the  representative  of 
those  who  have  committed  their  children  to  his 
charge.  Let  him  be  free  from  vice  himself  and 
refuse  to  tolerate  it  in  others.  Let  him  be  strict  but 
not  austere,  genial  but  not  too  familiar  :  for  austerity 
will  make  him  unpopular,  while  familiarity  breeds 
contempt.  Let  his  discourse  continually  turn  on  what 
is  good  and  honourable  ;  the  more  he  admonishes, 
the  less  he  will  have  to  punish.  He  must  control 
his  temper  without  however  shutting  his  eyes  to 
faults  requiring  correction  :  his  instruction  must  be 
free  from  affectation,  his  industry  great,  his  demands 
on  his  class  continuous,  but  not  extravagant.  He  6 
must  be  ready  to  answer  questions  and  to  put 
them  unasked  to  those  who  sit  silent.  In  praising 
the  recitations  of  his  pupils  he  must  be  neither 
grudging  nor  over-generous  :  the  former  quality  will 
give  them  a  distaste  for  work,  while  the  latter  will 
produce  a  complacent  self-satisfaction.  In  correcting  7 
faults  he  must  avoid  sarcasm  and  above  all  abuse  : 
for  teachers  whose  rebukes  seem  to  imply  positive 
dislike  discourage  industry.  He  should  declaim  8 
daily  himself  and,  what  is  more,  without  stint,  that 
his  class  may  take  his  utterances  home  with  them. 
For  however  many  models  for  imitation  he  may

give  them  from  the  authors  they  are  reading,  it  will 
still  be  found  that  fuller  nourishment  is  provided  by 
the  living  voice,  as  we  call  it,  more  especially  when 
it  proceeds  from  the  teacher  himself,  who,  if  his 
pupils  are  rightly  instructed,  should  be  the  object 
of  their  affection  and  respect.  And  it  is  scarcely 
possible  to  say  how  much  more  readily  we  imitate 
those  whom  we  like. 

I  strongly  disapprove  of  the  prevailing  practice  of  9 
allowing  boys  to  stand  up  or  leap  from  the  seats  in 
the  expression  of  their  applause.  Young  men,  even 
when  they  are  listening  to  others,  should  be 
temperate  in  manifesting  their  approval.  If  this 
be  insisted  upon,  the  pupil  will  depend  on  his 
instructor's  verdict  and  will  take  his  approval  as 
a  guarantee  that  he  has  spoken  well.  The  worst  10 
form  of  politeness,  as  it  has  come  to  be  called,  is 
that  of  mutual  and  indiscriminate  applause,  a  practice 
which  is  unseemly,  theatrical  and  unworthy  of  a 
decently  disciplined  school,  in  addition  to  being  the 
worst  foe  to  genuine  study.  For  if  every  effusion  is 
greeted  with  a  storm  of  ready-made  applause,  care 
and  industry  come  to  be  regarded  as  superfluous. 
The  audience  no  less  than  the  speaker  should  there-  11 
fore  keep  their  eyes  fixed  on  their  teacher's  face,  since 
thus  they  will  learn  to  distinguish  between  what  is 
praiseworthy  and  what  is  not:  for  just  as  writing 
gives  facility,  so  listening  begets  the  critical 
faculty.  But  in  the  schools  of  to-day  we  see  boys  12 
stooping  forward  ready  to  spring  to  their  feet :  at 
the  close  of  each  period  they  not  merely  rise,  but 
rush  forward  with  shouts  of  unseemly  enthusiasm. 
Such  compliments  are  mutual  and  the  success  of  a 
declamation  consists  in  this  kind  of  applause.  The

13  Sed    se   quoque    praeceptores    intente    ac    modeste

result  is  vanity  and  empty  self-sufficiency,  carried  to 
such  an  extent  that,  intoxicated  by  the  wild  enthus- 
iasm of  their  fellow-pupils,  they  conceive  a  spite 
against  their  master,  if  his  praise  does  not  come  up 
to  their  expectation.  But  teachers  must  also  insist  13 
on  receiving  an  attentive  and  quiet  hearing  from  the 
class  when  they  themselves  declaim.  For  the 
master  should  not  speak  to  suit  his  pupil's  standard, 
but  they  should  speak  to  suit  his.  Further  he  should, 
if  possible,  keep  his  eyes  open  to  note  the  points 
which  each  boy  praises  and  observe  the  manner  in 
which  he  expresses  his  approval,  and  should  rejoice 
that  his  words  give  pleasure  not  only  for  his  own 
sake,  but  for  that  of  those  who  show  sound  judg- 
ment in  their  appreciation. 

I  do  not  approve  of  boys  sitting  mixed  with  young  14 
men.  For  even  if  the  teacher  be  such  an  one  as  we 
should  desire  to  see  in  charge  of  the  morals  and 
studies  of  the  young,  and  can  keep  his  youthful 
pupils  under  proper  control,  it  is  none  the  less 
desirable  to  keep  the  weaker  members  separate  from 
the  more  mature,  and  to  avoid  not  only  the  actual 
charge  of  corruption  but  the  merest  suspicion  of  it. 
I  have  thought  it  worth  while  to  put  my  views  on  15 
this  subject  quite  briefly.  For  I  do  not  think  it 
necessary  even  to  warn  the  teacher  that  both  he  and 
his  school  must  be  free  from  the  grosser  vices.  And 
should  there  be  any  father  who  does  not  trouble  to 
choose  a  teacher  for  his  son  who  is  free  from  the 
obvious  taint  of  immorality,  he  may  rest  assured 
that  all  the  other  precepts,  which  I  am  attempting 
to  lay  down  for  the  benefit  of  our  youth,  will  be 
absolutely  useless  to  him,  if  he  neglects  this.

even  the  opinion  of  those  who,  even  when  they 
regard  boys  as  ripe  for  the  rhetorician,,  still  do  not 
think  that  they  should  at  once  be  placed  under  the 
most  eminent  teacher  available,  but  prefer  to  keep 
them  for  a  while  under  inferior  masters,  on  the 
ground  that  in  the  elementary  stages  a  mediocre 
instructor  is  easier  to  understand  and  to  imitate,  and 
less  reluctant  to  undertake  the  tiresome  task  of  teach- 
ing the  rudiments  as  being  beneath  his  notice.  I  do  2 
not  think  that  I  need  waste  much  time  in  pointing 
out  how  much  better  it  is  to  absorb  the  best  possible 
principles,  or  how  hard  it  is  to  get  rid  of  faults  which 
have  once  become  engrained  ;  for  it  places  a  double 
burden  on  the  shoulders  of  the  later  teacher  and 
the  preliminary  task  of  unteaching  is  harder  than 
that  of  teaching.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  3 
famous  piper  Timotheus  is  said  to  have  demanded 
from  those  who  had  previously  been  under  another 
master  a  fee  double  the  amount  which  he  charged 
for  those  wrho  came  to  him  untaught.  The  mistake 
to  which  I  am  referring  is,  however,  twofold.  First 
they  regard  these  inferior  teachers  as  adequate  for 
the  time  being  and  are  content  with  their  instruction 
because  they  have  a  stomach  that  will  swallow  any- 
thing :  this  indifference,  though  blameworthy  in  4 
itself,  would  yet  be  tolerable,  if  the  teaching  provided 
by  these  persons  were  merely  less  in  quantity  and 
not  inferior  in  quality  as  well.  Secondly,  and  this 
is  a  still  commoner  delusion,  they  think  that  those 
who  are  blest  with  greater  gifts  of  speaking  will  not 
condescend  to  the  more  elementary  details,  and  that 
consequently  they  sometimes  disdain  to  give  atten- 
tion to  such  inferior  subjects  of  study  and  sometimes 
are  incapable  of  so  doing.  For  my  part  I  regard  the  5

teacher  who  is  unwilling  to  attend  to  such  details 
as  being  unworthy  of  the  name  of  teacher :  and  as 
for  the  question  of  capacity,  I  maintain  that  it  is  the 
most  capable  man  who,  given  the  will,  is  able  to  do 
this  with  most  efficiency.  For  in  the  first  place  it  is  a 
reasonable  inference  that  a  man  blest  with  abnormal 
powers  of  eloquence  will  have  made  careful  note  of 
the  various  steps  by  which  eloquence  is  attained, 
and  in  the  second  place  the  reasoning  faculty,  which  6 
is  specially  developed  in  learned  men,  is  all-important 
in  teaching,  while  finally  no  one  is  eminent  in  the 
greater  things  of  his  art  if  he  be  lacking  in  the  lesser. 
Unless  indeed  we  are  asked  to  believe  that  while 
Phidias  modelled  his  Jupiter  to  perfection,  the 
decorative  details  of  the  statue  would  have  been 
better  executed  by  another  artist,  or  that  an  orator 
does  not  know  how  to  speak,  or  a  distinguished

deny  that  there  is  a  type  of  eloquence  that  is 
too  great  to  be  comprehended  by  undeveloped 
boys?"  Of  course  there  is.  But  this  eloquent 
teacher  whom  they  fling  in  my  face  must  be  a 
sensible  man  with  a  good  knowledge  of  teaching  and 
must  be  prepared  to  stoop  to  his  pupil's  level,  just  as 
a  rapid  walker,  if  walking  with  a  small  child,  will 
give  him  his  hand  and  lessen  his  own  speed  and 
avoid  advancing  at  a  pace  beyond  the  powers  of  his 
little  companion.  Again  it  frequently  happens  that  8 
the  more  learned  the  teacher,  the  more  lucid  and 
intelligible  is  his  instruction.  For  clearness  is  the 
first  virtue  of  eloquence,  and  the  less  talented  a  man 
is,  the  more  he  will  strive  to  exalt  and  dilate  himself, 
just  as  short  men  tend  to  walk  on  tip-toe  and  weak

men  to  use  threats.  As  for  those  whose  style  is  9 
inflated  or  vicious,  and  whose  language  reveals  a 
passion  for  high-sounding  words  or  labours  under 
any  other  form  of  affectation,  in  my  opinion  they 
suffer  not  from  excess  of  strength  but  of  weakness, 
like  bodies  swollen  not  with  the  plumpness  of 
health  but  with  disease,  or  like  men  who  weary  of 
the  direct  road  betake  them  to  bypaths.  Conse- 
quently the  worse  a  teacher  is,  the  harder  he  will 
be  to  understand. 

I  have  not  forgotten  that  I  stated  in  the  preced-  10 
ing  book,  when  I  urged  that  school  was  preferable 
to  home  education,  that  pupils  at  the  commence- 
ment of  their  studies,  when  progress  is  as  yet 
but  in  the  bud,  are  more  disposed  to  imitate  their 
schoolfellows  than  their  masters,  since  such  imitation 
comes  more  easily  to  them.  Some  of  my  readers 
may  think  that  the  view  which  I  am  now  maintaining 
is  inconsistent  with  my  previous  statement.  But  111 
am  far  from  being  inconsistent :  for  my  previous 
assertion  affords  the  strongest  reason  for  selecting  the 
very  best  teachers  for  our  boys  ;  since  pupils  of  a 
first  rate  master,  having  received  a  better  training, 
will  when  they  speak  say  something  that  may  be 
worthy  of  imitation,  while  if  they  commit  some 
mistake,  they  will  be  promptly  corrected.  But  the 
incompetent  teacher  on  the  other  hand  is  quite 
likely  to  give  his  approval  to  faulty  work  and  by  the 
judgment  which  he  expresses  to  force  approval 
on  the  audience.  The  teacher  should  therefore  be  12 
as  distinguished  for  his  eloquence  as  for  his  good 
character,  and  like  Phoenix  in  the  Iliad  be  able  to 
teach  his  pupil  both  how  to  behave  and  how  to 
speak.

IV.  I  shall  now  proceed  to  indicate  what  I  think 
should  be  the  first  subjects  in  which  the  rhetorician 
should  give  instruction,  and  shall  postpone  for  a 
time  our  consideration  of  the  art  of  rhetoric  in  the 
narrow  sense  in  which  that  term  is  popularly  used. 
For  in  my  opinion  it  is  most  desirable  that  we 
should  commence  with  something  resembling  the 
subjects  already  acquired  under  the  teacher  of 
literature. 

Now  there  are  three  forms  of  narrative,  without  2 
counting  the  type  used  in  actual  legal  cases.      First 
there    is   the    fictitious    narrative    as    we    get    it    in 
tragedies  and  poems,  which  is  not  merely  not  true 
but  has  little  resemblance  to  truth.1    Secondly,  there 
is  the  realistic  narrative  as  presented  by  comedies, 
which,  though  not  true,  has  yet  a  certain  verisimili- 
tude.    Thirdly  there  is  the  historical  narrative,  which 
is  an   exposition  of  actual    fact.      Poetic   narratives 
are  the  property  of  the  teacher  of  literature.     The 
rhetorician    therefore    should    begin    with    the    his- 
torical narrative,  whose  force  is  in  proportion  to  its 
truth.      I  will,  however,  postpone  my  demonstration  3 
of  what  I  regard  as   the  best  method  of  narration 
till  I  come  to  deal  with  narration  as  required  in  the 
courts.2     In  the  meantime,  it  vrill   be   sufficient  to 
urge  that  it  should  be  neither  dry  nor  jejune  (for 
why  spend  so  much  labour  over  our  studies  if  a  bald 
and  naked  statement  of  fact  is  regarded  as  sufficiently 
expressive  ?) ;    nor  on  the    other   hand  must    it    be 
tortuous   or    revel    in    elaborate    descriptions,   such 
as    those    in    wrhich    so    many  are    led    to    indulge 
by  a  misguided   imitation  of  poetic  licence.      Both  4 
these  extremes  are  faults;    but  that  which  springs 
from  poverty  of  wit  is  worse  than  that  which  is  due

to  imaginative  excess.  For  we  cannot  demand  or 
expect  a  perfect  style  from  boys.  But  there  is 
greater  promise  in  a  certain  luxuriance  of  mind,  in 
ambitious  effort  and  an  ardour  that  leads  at  times  to 
ideas  bordering  on  the  extravagant.  I  have  no  ob-  5 
jection  to  a  little  exuberance  in  the  young  learner. 
Nay,  I  would  urge  teachers  too  like  nurses  to  be 
careful  to  provide  softer  food  for  still  undeveloped 
minds  and  to  suffer  them  to  take  their  fill  of  the  milk 
of  the  more  attractive  studies.  For  the  time  being 
the  body  may  be  somewhat  plump,  but  maturer  years 
will  reduce  it  to  a  sparer  habit.  Such  plumpness  6 
gives  hope  of  strength ;  a  child  fully  formed  in 
every  limb  is  likely  to  grow  up  a  puny  weakling. 
The  young  should  be  more  daring  and  inventive 
and  should  rejoice  in  their  inventions,  even  though 
correctness  and  severity  are  still  to  be  acquired. 
Exuberance  is  easilv  remedied,  but  barrenness  is 

j 

incurable,  be  your  efforts  what  they  may.  To  my  7 
mind  the  boy  who  gives  least  promise  is  one  in 
whom  the  critical  faculty  develops  in  advance  of  the 
imagination.  I  like  to  see  the  firstfruits  of  the  mind 
copious  to  excess  and  almost  extravagant  in  their 
profusion.  The  years  as  they  pass  will  skim  off 
much  of  the  froth,  reason  will  file  away  many 
excrescences,  and  something  too  will  be  removed 
by  what  I  may  perhaps  call  the  wear  and  tear  of 
life,  so  long  as  there  is  sufficient  material  to  admit 
of  cutting  and  chiselling  away.  And  there  will 
be  sufficient,  if  only  we  do  not  draw  the  plate  too 
thin  to  begin  with,  so  that  it  runs  the  risk  of  being 
broken  if  the  graver  cut  too  deep.  Those  of  my  8 
readers  who  know  their  Cicero  will  not  be  surprised

that  I  take  this  view  :  for  does  he  not  say  "  I  would 
have  the  youthful  mind  run  riot  in  the  luxuriance  of 
its  growth  "  ? l 

We  must,  therefore,  take  especial  care,  above 
all  where  boys  are  concerned,  to  avoid  a  dry 
teacher,  even  as  we  avoid  a  dry  and  arid  soil  for 
plants  that  are  still  young  and  tender.  For  with  9 
such  a  teacher  their  growth  is  stunted  and  their 
eyes  are  turned  earthwards,  and  they  are  afraid  to 
rise  above  the  level  of  daily  speech.  Their  leanness 
is  regarded  as  a  sign  of  health  and  their  weakness  as 
a  sign  of  sound  judgment,  and  while  they  are  con- 
tent that  their  work  should  be  devoid  of  faults  they 
fall  into  the  fault  of  being  devoid  of  merit.  So  let 
not  the  ripeness  of  vintage  come  too  soon  nor  the 
must  turn  harsh  while  yet  in  the  vat ;  thus  it  will 
last  for  years  and  mellow  with  age. 

It  is  worth  while  too  to  warn  the  teacher  that  10 
undue  severity  in  correcting  faults  is  liable  at  times 
to  discourage  a  boy's  mind  from  effort.  He  loses 
hope  and  gives  way  to  vexation,  then  last  of  all 
comes  to  hate  his  work  and  fearing  everything  at- 
tempts nothing.  This  phenomenon  is  familiar  to  11 
farmers,  who  hold  that  the  pruning-hook  should  not 
be  applied  while  the  leaves  are  yet  young,  for  they 
seem  to  "shrink  from  the  steel"  2  and  to  be  unable 
as  yet  to  endure  a  scar.  The  instructor  therefore  12 
should  be  as  kindly  as  possible  at  this  stage ;  reme- 
dies, which  are  harsh  by  nature,  must  be  applied  with 
a  gentle  hand  :  some  portions  of  the  work  must  be 
praised,  others  tolerated  and  others  altered :  the 
reason  for  the  alterations  should  however  be  given, 
and  in  some  cases  the  master  will  illumine  an 
obscure  passage  by  inserting  something  of  his  own.

Occasionally  again  the  teacher  will  find  it  useful  to 
dictate  whole  themes  himself  that  the  boy  may 
imitate  them  and  for  the  time  being  love  them  as  if 
they  were  his  own.  But  if  a  boy's  composition  is  so  13 
careless  as  not  to  admit  of  correction,  I  have  found 
it  useful  to  give  a  fresh  exposition  of  the  theme  and 
to  tell  him  to  write  it  again,  pointing  out  that  he 
was  capable  of  doing  better  :  for  there  is  nothing 
like  hope  for  making  study  a  pleasure.  Different  14 
ages  however  demand  different  methods  :  the  task 
set  and  the  standard  of  correction  must  be  propor- 
tioned to  the  pupil's  strength.  When  boys  ventured 
on  something  that  was  too  daring  or  exuberant,  I 
used  to  say  to  them  that  I  approved  of  it  for  the 
moment,  but  that  the  time  would  come  when  I 
should  no  longer  tolerate  such  a  style.  The  result 
was  that  the  consciousness  of  ability  filled  them  with 
pleasure,  without  blinding  their  judgment. 

However,  to  return  to  the  point  from  which  I  had  15 
digressed.  Written  narratives  should  be  composed 
with  the  utmost  care.  It  is  useful  at  first,  when  a 
child  has  just  begun  to  speak,  to  make  him  repeat 
what  he  has  heard  with  a  view  to  improving  his 
powers  of  speech  ;  and  for  the  same  purpose,  and 
with  good  reason,  I  would  make  him  tell  his  story 
from  the  end  back  to  the  beginning  or  start  in  the 
middle  and  go  backwards  or  forwards,  but  only  so 
long  as  he  is  at  his  teacher's  knee  and  while  he  is 
incapable  of  greater  effort  and  is  beginning  to  con- 
nect words  and  things,  thereby  strengthening  the 
memory.  Even  so  when  he  is  beginning  to  under- 
stand the  nature  of  correct  and  accurate  speech, 
extempore  effusions,  improvised  without  waiting 
for  thought  to  supply  the  matter  or  a  moment's

hesitation  before  rising  to  the  feet,  must  not  be  per- 
mitted :  they  proceed  from  a  passion  for  display  that 
would  do  credit  to  a  common  mountebank.  Such  16 
proceedings  fill  ignorant  parents  with  senseless  pride, 
while  the  boys  themselves  lose  all  respect  for  their 
work,  adopt  a  conceited  bearing,  and  acquire  the 
habit  of  speaking  in  the  worst  style  and  actually  prac- 
tising their  faults,  while  they  develop  an  arrogant  con- 
viction of  their  own  talents  which  often  proves  fatal 
even  to  the  most  genuine  proficiency.  There  will  be  17 
a  special  time  for  acquiring  fluency  of  speech  and  I 
shall  not  pass  the  subject  by  unnoticed.  For  the  mean- 
time it  will  suffice  if  a  boy,  by  dint  of  taking  pains  and 
working  as  hard  as  his  age  will  permit,  manages  to 
produce  something  worthy  of  approval.  Let  him  get 
used  to  this  until  it  becomes  a  second  nature.  It  is 
only  he  who  learns  to  speak  correctly  before  he  can 
speak  with  rapidity  who  will  reach  the  heights  that 
are  our  goal  or  the  levels  immediately  below  them. 

To  narratives  is  annexed  the  task  of  refuting  and  18 
confirming  them,  styled  anaskeue  and  kataskeue,  from 
which  no  little  advantage  may  be  derived.  This  may 
be  done  not  merely  in  connexion  with  fiction  and 
stories  transmitted  by  the  poets,  but  with  the  actual 
records  of  history  as  well.  For  instance  we  may  dis- 
cuss the  credibility  of  the  story  that  a  raven  settled 
on  the  head  of  Valerius  in  the  midst  of  a  combat  and 
with  its  wings  and  beak  struck  the  eyes  of  the  Gaul 
who  was  his  adversary,  and  a  quantity  of  arguments 
may  be  produced  on  either  side  :  or  we  may  discuss  19 
the  tradition  that  Scipio1  was  begotten  by  a  serpent, 
or  that  Romulus  was  suckled  by  the  she-wolf,  or  the 
story  of  Numa  and  Egeria.  As  regards  Greek  his- 
tory, it  allows  itself  something  very  like  poetic

licence.  Again  the  time  and  place  of  some  particu- 
lar occurrence  and  sometimes  even  the  persons  con- 
cerned often  provide  matter  for  discussion  :  Livy  for 
instance  is  frequently  in  doubt  as  to  what  actually 
occurred  and  historians  often  disagree. 

From  this  our  pupil  will  begin  to  proceed  to  more  20 
important  themes,  such  as  the  praise  of  famous  men 
and  the  denunciation  of  the  wicked.  Such  tasks  are 
profitable  in  more  than  one  respect.  The  mind  is 
exercised  by  the  variety  arid  multiplicity  of  the  sub- 
ject matter,  while  the  character  is  moulded  by  the 
contemplation  of  virtue  and  vice.  Further  wide 
knowledge  of  facts  is  thus  acquired,  from  which  ex- 
amples may  be  drawn  if  circumstances  so  demand, 
such  illustrations  being  of  the  utmost  value  in  every 
kind  of  case.  It  is  but  a  step  from  this  to  practice  21 
in  the  comparison  of  the  respective  merits  of  two 
characters.  This  is  of  course  a  very  similar  theme 
to  the  preceding,  but  involves  a  duplication  of  the 
subject  matter  and  deals  not  merely  with  the  nature 
of  virtues  and  vices,  but  with  their  degree  as  well. 
But  the  method  to  be  followed  in  panegyric  and  in- 
vective will  be  dealt  with  in  its  proper  place,  as  it 
forms  the  third  department  of  rhetoric.1 

As  to  commonplaces  (I  refer  to  those  in  which  22 
we  denounce  vices  themselves  such  as  adultery, 
gambling  or  profligacy  without  attacking  parti- 
cular persons),  they  come  straight  from  the  courts 
and,  if  we  add  the  name  of  the  defendant,  amount 
to  actual  accusations.  As  a  rule,  however,  the 
general  character  of  a  commonplace  is  usually 
given  a  special  turn  :  for  instance  we  make  our 
adulterer  blind,  our  gambler  poor  and  our  profligate 
far  advanced  in  years.  Sometimes  too  they  entail

defence  :  for  we  may  speak  on  behalf  of  luxury  or  23 
love,  while  a  pimp  or  a  parasite  may  be  defended  in 
such  a  way  that  we  appear  as  counsel  not  for  the 
character   itself,  but  to  rebut  some  specific  charge 
that  is  brought  against  him. 

Theses  on  the  other  hand  are  concerned  with  24 
the  comparison  of  things  and  involve  questions  such 
as  "  Which  is  preferable,  town  or  country  life  ?  ' 
or  "Which  deserves  the  greatest  praise,  the  lawyer 
or  the  soldier?  '  These  provide  the  most  attractive 
and  copious  practice  in  the  art  of  speaking,  and  are 
most  useful  whether  we  have  an  eye  to  the  duties 
of  deliberative  oratory  or  the  arguments  of  the 
courts.  For  instance  Cicero  in  his  pro  Murena  ]  deals 
very  fully  with  the  second  of  the  two  problems 
mentioned  above.  Other  theses  too  belong  entirely  25 
to  the  deliberative  class  of  oratory,  as  for  instance 
the  questions  as  to  <l  Whether  marriage  is  desir- 
able '  or  "  Whether  a  public  career  is  a  proper 
object  of  ambition."  Put  such  discussions  into 
the  mouths  of  specific  persons  and  they  become 
deliberative  declamations  at  once. 

My  own  teachers  used  to  prepare  us  for  conject-  26 
ural  cases  by  a  form  of  exercise  which  was  at  once 
useful  and  attractive :  they  made  us  discuss  and 
develop  questions  such  as  "  Why  in  Sparta  is  Venus 
represented  as  wearing  armour?"2  or  "Why  is  Cupid 
believed  to  be  a  winged  boy  armed  with  arrows  and 
a  torch  ?  "  and  the  like.  In  these  exercises  our  aim 
was  to  discover  the  intention  implied,  a  question 
which  frequently  occurs  in  controversial  declamations. 
Such  themes  may  perhaps  be  regarded  as  a  kind  ot 
chria  or  moral  essay.

whether  we  should  always  believe  a  witness  or 
whether  we  should  rely  on  circumstantial  evidence, 
are  part  and  parcel  of  actual  forensic  pleading  is  so 
obvious  that  certain  speakers,  men  too  who  have 
held  civil  office  with  no  small  distinction,  have 
written  out  passages  dealing  with  such  themes,  com- 
mitted them  to  memory  and  kept  them  ready  for 
immediate  use,  with  a  view  to  employing  them  when 
occasion  arose  as  a  species  of  ornament  to  be  inserted 
into  their  extempore  speeches.  This  practice —  28 
for  I  am  not  going  to  postpone  expressing  my  judg- 
ment on  it — I  used  to  regard  a  confession  of  ex- 
treme weakness.  For  how  can  such  men  find  appro- 
priate arguments  in  the  course  of  actual  cases  which 
continually  present  new  and  different  features? 
How  can  they  answer  the  points  that  their  opponents 
may  bring  up  ?  how  deal  a  rapid  counterstroke  in 
debate  or  cross-examine  a  witness  ?  if,  even  in  those 
matters  which  are  of  common  occurrence  and  crop 
up  in  the  majority  of  cases,  they  cannot  give  expres- 
sion to  the  most  familiar  thoughts  except  in  words 
prepared  so  far  in  advance.  And  when  they  produce  29 
the  same  passage  in  a  number  of  different  cases,  they 
must  come  to  loathe  it  like  food  that  has  grown  cold 
or  stale,  and  they  can  hardly  avoid  a  feeling  of  shame 
at  displaying  this  miserable  piece  of  furniture  to  an 
audience  whose  memory  must  have  detected  it  so 
many  times  already :  like  the  furniture  of  the 
ostentatious  poor,  it  is  sure  to  shew  signs  of  wear 
through  being  used  for  such  a  variety  of  different 
purposes.  Also  it  must  be  remembered  that  there  30 
is  hardly  a  single  commonplace  of  such  universal 
application  that  it  will  fit  any  actual  case,  unless

the  subject  :  otherwise  it  will  seem  to  have  been 
tacked  on  to  the  speech,  not  interwoven  in  its 
texture,  either  because  it  is  out  of  keeping  with  the  31 
circumstances  orlike  mostof  its  kind  is  inappropriately 
employed  not  because  it  is  wanted,  but  because  it  is 
ready  for  use.  Some  speakers,  for  example,  introduce 
the  most  long-winded  commonplaces  just  for  the  sake 
of  the  sentiments  they  contain,  whereas  rightly  the 
sentiments  should  spring  from  the  context.  Such  32 
disquisitions  are  at  once  ornamental  and  useful,  only  if 
they  arise  from  the  nature  of  the  case.  But  the  most 
finished  eloquence,  unless  it  tend  to  the  winning  of 
the  case,  is  to  say  the  least  superfluous  and  may  even 
defeat  its  own  purpose.  However  I  must  bring  this 
digression  to  a  close. 

The  praise  or  denunciation  of  laws  requires  greater  33 
powers  ;  indeed  they  should  almost  be  equal  to  the 
most  serious  tasks  of  rhetoric.  The  answer  to  the 
question  as  to  whether  this  exercise  is  more  nearly 
related  to  deliberative  or  controversial  oratory 
depends  on  custom  and  law  and  consequently  varies 
in  different  states.  Among  the  Greeks  the  proposer 
of  a  law  was  called  upon  to  set  forth  his  case  before 
a  judge,1  while  in  Rome  it  was  the  custom  to  urge 
the  acceptance  or  rejection  of  a  law  before  the  public 
assembly.  But  in  any  case  the  arguments  advanced 
in  such  cases  are  few  in  number  and  of  a  definite 
type.  For  there  are  only  three  kinds  of  law,  sacred, 
public  and  private.  This  division  is  of  rhetorical  value  3J 
chiefly  when  a  law  is  to  be  praised.  For  example  the 
orator  may  advance  from  praise  to  praise  by  a  series  of 
gradations,  praising  an  enactment  first  because  it  is 
law,  secondly  because  it  is  public,  and,  finally,  designed 
for  the  support  of  religion.  As  regards  the  questions

which  generally  arise,  they  are  common  to  all  cases. 
Doubts  may  be  raised  as  to  whether  the  mover  is  35 
legally  in  a  position  to  propose  a  law,  as  happened  in 
the  case  of  Publius  Clodius,  whose  appointment  as 
tribune  of  the  plebs  was  alleged  to  be  unconstitu- 
tional.1    Or  the  legality  of  the  proposal  itself  may 
be  impugned  in  various  ways  ;  it  may  for  instance  be 
urged    that    the    law    was    not   promulgated   within 
seventeen  2   days,  or  was  proposed,  or  is  being  pro- 
posed   on   an    improper  day,  or   in   defiance  of  the 
tribunicial  veto  or   the  auspices   or  any  other  legal 
obstacle,  or  again  that  it  is  contrary  to  some  exist- 
ing law.       But    such    points    are    not    suitable    to  36 
elementary  rhetorical  exercises,  which  are  not  con- 
cerned   with     persons,    times     or    particular    cases. 
Other  subjects,  whether  the  dispute  be  real  or  fic- 
titious, are  generally  treated  on  the  following  lines. 
The    fault    must   lie    either    in    the    words    or    the  37 
matter.     As  regards   the    words,   the   question   will 
be    whether  they  are    sufficiently  clear    or    contain 
some  ambiguity,  and  as  regards  the  matter  whether 
the  law  is  consistent  with  itself  or  should  be  retro- 
spective or  apply  to  special  individuals.      The.  point 
however    which    is    most    commonly    raised    is    the 
question  whether  the  law  is  right  or  expedient.      I  38 
am  well  aware  that  many  rhetoricians   introduce  a 
number  of  sub-divisions  in  connexion  with  this  latter 
enquiry.     I   however  include  under  the  term  right 
all    such    qualities    as   justice,    piety    and    religion. 
Justice   is  however  usually  discussed  under  various 
aspects.      A  question  may  be  raised  about  the  acts 
with  which  the  law  is  concerned,  as  to  whether  they

deserve  punishment  or  reward  or  as  to  the  degree  of 
punishment  or  reward  that  should  be  assigned,  since 
excess  in  either  direction  is  open  to  criticism.  Again  39 
expediency  is  sometimes  determined  by  the  nature 
of  things,  sometimes  by  the  circumstances  of  the  time. 
Another  common  subject  of  controversy  is  whether 
a  law  can  be  enforced,  while  one  must  not  shut  one's 
eyes  to  the  fact  that  exception  is  sometimes  taken 
to  laws  in  their  entirety,  but  sometimes  only  in 
part,  examples  of  both  forms  of  criticism  being 
found  in  famous  speeches.  I  am  well  aware,  too,  40 
that  there  are  laws  which  are  not  proposed  with 
a  view  to  perpetuity,  but  are  concerned  with  tem- 
porary honours  or  commands,  such  as  the  lex  Manilla l 
which  is  the  subject  of  one  of  Cicero's  speeches. 
This  however  is  not  the  place  for  instructions  on 
this  topic,  since  they  depend  on  the  special  circum- 
stances of  the  matters  under  discussion,  not  on  their 
general  characteristics. 

Such  were  the  subjects  on  which  the  ancients  as  41 
a  rule  exercised  their  powers  of  speaking,  though 
they  called  in  the  assistance  of  the  logicians  as  well 
to  teach  them  the  theory  of  argument.  For  it  is 
generally  agreed  that  the  declamation  of  fictitious 
themes  in  imitation  of  the  questions  that  arise  in 
the  lawcourts  or  deliberative  assemblies  came  into 
vogue  among  the  Greeks  about  the  time  of  De- 
metrius of  Phalerum.  Whether  this  type  of  exer-  42 
cise  was  actually  invented  by  him  I  have  failed  to 
discover,  as  I  have  acknowledged  in  another  work.2 
But  not  even  those  who  most  strongly  assert  his 
claim  to  be  the  inventor,  can  produce  any  adequate 
authority  in  support  of  their  opinion.  As  regards

most  famous,  Cicero  1  informs  us  that  they  came  into 
existence  towards  the  end  of  the  age  of  Crassus. 

V.  I  will  speak  of  the  theory  of  declamation  a 
little  later.  In  the  mean  time,  as  we  are  discussing 
the  elementary  stages  of  a  rhetorical  education,  I 
think  I  should  not  fail  to  point  out  how  greatly  the 
rhetorician  will  contribute  to  his  pupils'  progress,  if 
he  imitates  the  teacher  of  literature  whose  duty  it  is 
to  expound  the  poets,  and  gives  the  pupils  whom  he 
has  undertaken  to  train,  instruction  in  the  reading 
of  history  and  still  more  of  the  orators.  I  myself 
have  adopted  this  practice  for  the  benefit  of  a  few 
pupils  of  suitable  age  whose  parents  thought  it 
would  be  useful.  But  though  my  intentions  were  2 
excellent,  I  found  that  there  were  two  serious  ob- 
stacles to  success  :  long  custom  had  established  a 
different  method  of  teaching,  and  my  pupils  were 
for  the  most  part  full-grown  youths  who  did  not 
require  this  form  of  teaching,  but  were  taking  my 
work  as  their  model.  However,  the  fact  that  I  3 
have  been  somewhat  late  in  making  the  discovery  is 
not  a  reason  why  I  should  be  ashamed  to  recommend 
it  to  those  who  come  after  me.  I  now  know  that  this 
form  of  teaching  is  practised  by  the  Greeks,  but  is 
generally  entrusted  to  assistants,  as  the  professors 
themselves  consider  that  they  have  no  time  to  give 
individual  instruction  to  each  pupil  as  he  reads. 
And  I  admit  that  the  form  of  lecture  which  this  4 
requires,  designed  as  it  is  to  make  boys  follow  the 
written  word  with  ease  and  accuracy,  and  even  that 
which  aims  at  teaching  the  meaning  of  any  rare 
words  that  may  occur,  are  to  be  regarded  as  quite 
below  the  dignity  of  the  teacher  of  rhetoric.  On  5 
the  other  hand  it  is  emphatically  part  of  his  pro-

fession  and  the  undertaking  which  he  makes  in 
offering  himself  as  a  teacher  of  eloquence,  to  point 
out  the  merits  of  authors  or,  for  that  matter,  any 
faults  that  may  occur :  and  this  is  all  the  more  the 
case,  as  I  am  not  asking  teachers  to  undertake  the 
task  of  recalling  their  pupils  to  standat  their  knee  once 
more  and  of  assisting  them  in  the  reading  of  what- 
ever book  they  may  select.  It  seems  to  me  at  once  6 
an  easier  and  more  profitable  method  to  call  for 
silence  and  choose  some  one  pupil — and  it  will  be 
best  to  select  them  by  turns — to  read  aloud,  in 
order  that  they  may  at  the  same  time  learn  the 
correct  method  of  elocution.  The  case  with  which  7 
the  speech  selected  for  reading  is  concerned  should 
then  be  explained,  for  if  this  be  done  they  will 
have  a  clearer  understanding  of  what  is  to  be  read. 
When  the  reading  is  commenced,  no  important 
point  should  be  allowed  to  pass  unnoticed  either 
as  regards  the  resourcefulness  or  the  style  shown 
in  the  treatment  of  the  subject :  the  teacher  must 
point  out  how  the  orator  seeks  to  win  the  favour 
of  the  judge  in  his  exordium,  what  clearness,  brevity 
and  sincerity,  and  at  times  what  shrewd  design  and 
well-concealed  artifice  is  shown  in  the  statement  of 
facts.  For  the  only  true  art  in  pleading  is  that  8 
which  can  only  be  understood  by  one  who  is  a 
master  of  the  art  himself.  The  teacher  will  proceed 
further  to  demonstrate  what  skill  is  shown  in  the  divi- 
sion into  heads,  how  subtle  and  frequent  are  the  thrusts 
of  argument,  what  vigour  marks  the  stirring  and 
what  charm  the  soothing  passage,  how  fierce  is  the 
invective  and  how  full  of  wit  the  jests,  and  in 
conclusion  how  the  orator  establishes  his  sway 
over  the  emotions  of  his  audience,  forces  his  way

jury  into  perfect  sympathy  with  all  his  words. 
Finally  as  regards  the  style,  he  will  emphasise  the  9 
appropriateness,,  elegance  or  sublimity  of  particular 
words,  will  indicate  wrhere  the  amplification  of  the 
theme  is  deserving  of  praise  and  where  there  is 
virtue  in  a  diminuendo;  and  will  call  attention  to 
brilliant  metaphors,  figures  of  speech  and  passages 
combining  smoothness  and  polish  with  a  general 
impression  of  manly  vigour. 

It  will  even  at  times  be  of  value  to  read  speeches  10 
which  are  corrupt  and  faulty  in  style,  but  still  meet 
with  general  admiration  thanks  to  the  perversity  of 
modern  tastes,  and  to  point  out  how  many  expres- 
sions in  them  are  inappropriate,  obscure,  high-flown, 
grovelling,  mean,  extravagant  or  effeminate,  although 
they  are  not  merely  praised  by  the  majority  of  critics, 
but,  worse  still,  praised  just  because  they  are  bad.  For  1 1 
we  have  come  to  regard  direct  and  natural  speech 
as  incompatible  with  genius,  while  all  that  is  in  any 
way  abnormal  is  admired  as  exquisite.  Similarly  we 
see  that  some  people  place  a  higher  value  on  figures 
which  are  in  any  way  monstrous  or  distorted  than 
they  do  on  those  who  have  not  lost  any  of  the  ad- 
vantages of  the  normal  form  of  man.  There  are  12 
even  some  who  are  captivated  by  the  shams  of  artifice 
and  think  that  there  is  more  beauty  in  those  who 
pluck  out  superfluous  hair  or  use  depilatories,  who 
dress  their  locks  by  scorching  them  with  the  curling 
iron  and  glow  with  a  complexion  that  is  not  their 
own,  than  can  ever  be  conferred  by  nature  pure  and 
simple,  so  that  it  really  seems  as  if  physical  beauty 
depended  entirely  on  moral  hideousness. 

It  will,  however,  be  the  duty  of  the   rhetorician  13

not  merely  to  teach  these  things,  but  to  ask  frequent 
questions  as  well,  and  test  the  critical  powers  of  his 
class.  This  will  prevent  his  audience  from  becoming 
inattentive  and  will  secure  that  his  words  do  not  fall 
on  deaf  ears.  At  the  same  time  the  class  will  be  led 
to  find  out  tilings  for  themselves  and  to  use  their 
intelligence,  which  is  after  all  the  chief  aim  of  this 
method  of  training.  For  what  else  is  our  object  in 
teaching,  save  that  our  pupils  should  not  always 
require  to  be  taught?  I  will  venture  to  say  that  14 
this  particular  form  of  exercise,  if  diligently  pursued, 
will  teach  learners  more  than  all  the  text-books  of 
all  the  rhetoricians :  these  are  no  doubt  of  very 
considerable  use,  but  being  somewhat  general  in 
their  scope,  it  is  quite  impossible  for  them  to  deal 
with  all  the  special  cases  that  are  of  almost  daily 
occurrence.  The  art  of  war  will  provide  a  parallel :  15 
it  is  no  doubt  based  on  certain  general  principles, 
but  it  will  none  the  less  be  far  more  useful  to  know 
the  methods  employed,  whether  wisely  or  the  re- 
verse, by  individual  generals  under  varying  circum- 
stances and  conditions  of  time  and  place.  For  there 
are  no  subjects  in  which,  as  a  rule,  practice  is  not 
more  valuable  than  precept.  Is  a  teacher  to  declaim  16 
to  provide  a  model  for  his  audience,  and  will  not 
more  profit  be  derived  from  the  reading  of  Cicero  or 
Demosthenes  ?  Is  a  pupil  to  be  publicly  corrected 
if  he  makes  a  mistake  in  declaiming,  and  will  it  not 
be  more  useful,  and  more  agreeable  too,  to  correct 
some  actual  speech?  For  everyone  has  a  preference 
for  hearing  the  faults  of  others  censured  rather  than 
his  own.  I  might  say  more  on  the  subject.  But  17 
everv  one  can  see  the  advantages  of  this  method. 
Would  that  the  reluctance  to  put  it  into  practice

were  not  as  great  as   the   pleasure  that  would  un- 
doubtedly be  derived  from  so  doing  ! 

This  method  once  adopted,  we  are  faced  by  the  18 
comparatively  easy  question  as  to  what  authors 
should  be  selected  for  our  reading.  Some  have  re- 
commended authors  of  inferior  merit  on  the  ground 
that  they  were  easier  to  understand.  Others  on  the 
contrary  would  select  the  more  florid  school  of  writers 
on  the  ground  that  they  are  likely  to  provide  the 
nourishment  best  suited  to  the  minds  of  the  young. 
For  my  part  I  would  have  them  read  the  best  authors  19 
from  the  very  beginning  and  never  leave  them, 
choosing  those,  however,  who  are  simplest  and  most 
intelligible.  For  instance,  when  prescribing  for  boys, 
I  should  give  Livy  the  preference  over  Sallust ; 
for,  although  the  latter  is  the  greater  historian, 
one  requires  to  be  well-advanced  in  one's  studies 
to  appreciate  him  properly.  Cicero,  in  my  opinion,  20 
provides  pleasant  reading  for  beginners  and  is  suffi- 
ciently easy  to  understand  :  it  is  possible  not  only 
to  learn  much  from  him,  but  to  come  to  love  him. 
After  Cicero  I  should,  following  the  advice  of  Livy, 
place  such  authors  as  most  nearly  resemble  him. 

There  are  two  faults  of  taste  against  which  boys  21 
should  be  guarded  with  the  utmost  care.  Firstly 
no  teacher  suffering  from  an  excessive  admiration 
of  antiquity,  should  be  allowed  to  cramp  their 
minds  by  the  study  of  Cato  and  the  Gracchi  and 
other  similar  authors.  For  such  reading  will  give 
them  a  harsh  and  bloodless  style,  since  they  will  as 
yet  be  unable  to  understand  the  force  and  vigour  of 
these  authors,  and  contenting  themselves  with  a 
style  which  doubtless  was  admirable  in  its  day,  but 
is  quite  unsuitable  to  ours,  will  come  to  think  (and

nothing  could  be  more  fatal)  that  they  really  resem- 
ble great  men.  Secondly  the  opposite  extreme  must  22 
be  equally  avoided  :  they  must  not  be  permitted  to 
fall  victims  to  the  pernicious  allurements  of  the 
precious  blooms  produced  by  our  modern  euphuists, 
thus  acquiring  a  passion  for  the  luscious  sweetness 
of  such  authors,  whose  charm  is  all  the  more  attrac- 
tive to  boyish  intellects  because  it  is  so  easy  of 
achievement.  Once,  however,  the  judgment  is  23 
formed  and  out  of  danger  of  perversion,,  I  should 
strongly  recommend  the  reading  of  ancient  authors, 
since  if,  after  clearing  away  all  the  uncouthness  of 
those  rude  ages,  we  succeed  in  absorbing  the  robust 
vigour  and  virility  of  their  native  genius,  our  more 
finished  style  will  shine  with  an  added  grace  : 
I  also  approve  the  study  of  the  moderns  at 
this  stage,  since  even  they  have  many  merits. 
For  nature  has  not  doomed  us  to  be  dullards,  24 
but  we  have  altered  our  style  of  oratory  and  in- 
dulged our  caprices  over  much.  It  is  in  their  ideals 
rather  than  their  talents  that  the  ancients  show 
themselves  our  superiors.  It  will  therefore  be 
possible  to  select  much  that  is  valuable  from  modern 
writers,  but  we  must  take  care  that  the  precious 
metal  is  not  debased  by  the  dross  with  which  it  is 
so  closely  intermingled.  Further  I  would  not  25 
merely  gladly  admit,  but  would  even  contend  that 
we  have  recently  had  and  still  have  certain  authors 
who  deserve  imitation  in  their  entirety.  But  it  is  26 
not  for  everyone  to  decide  who  these  writers  are. 
Error  in  the  choice  of  earlier  authors  is  attended 
with  less  danger,  and  I  have  therefore  postponed 
the  study  of  the  moderns,  for  fear  that  we  should 
imitate  them  before  we  are  qualified  to  judge  of 
their  merits.  - ,_

VI.  I  come  now  to  another  point  in  which  the 
practice  of  teachers  has  differed.  Some  have  not  been 
content  with  giving  directions  as  to  the  arrange- 
ment of  the  subjects  set  diem  as  themes  for 
declamation,  but  have  developed  them  at  some 
length  themselves,  supplying  not  merely  the  proofs, 
but  the  lines  upon  which  the  emotional  passages 
should  proceed.  Others  have  merely  suggested  a  2 
bare  outline,  and  then  when  the  declamations  were 
over,  have  indicated  the  points  missed  by  each 
speaker  and  worked  up  certain  passages  with  no  less 
care  than  they  would  have  used,  had  they  been  going 
to  stand  up  to  speak  themselves.  Both  practices 
have  their  advantages,  and  therefore  I  will  not  give 
either  the  pre-eminence.  But  if  we  must  choose  one 
of  the  two,  it  will  be  found  more  profitable  to  point 
out  the  right  road  at  the  outset,  and  not  merely  to 
recall  the  pupil  from  his  error  when  he  has  already 
gone  astray,  since  in  the  first  place  the  correction  3 
is  only  received  by  the  ear,  whereas  when  he  is 
given  a  sketch  of  the  various  heads  of  the  declama- 
tion, he  has  to  take  them  down  and  think  about 
them  :  secondly  instruction  is  always  more  readily 
received  than  reproof.  Indeed  those  of  our  pupils 
who  have  a  lively  disposition  are  liable  in  the 
present  condition  of  manners  to  lose  their  temper 
when  admonished  and  to  offer  silent  resistance. 
That,  however,  is  no  reason  for  refraining  from  4 
the  public  correction  of  faults  ;  for  we  must  take 
the  rest  of  the  class  into  account,  who  will  believe 
that  whatever  has  not  been  corrected  by  the  master 
is  right.  The  two  methods  should  be  employed 
conjointly  and  in  such  a  way  as  circumstances  may 
demand.  Beginners  must  be  given  a  subject  5

sketched  out  ready  for  treatment  and  suitable  to 
their  respective  powers.  But  when  they  show  that 
they  have  formed  themselves  sufficiently  closely  on 
the  models  placed  before  them,  it  will  be  sufficient 
to  give  them  a  few  brief  hints  for  their  guidance 
and  to  allow  them  to  advance  trusting  in  their  own 
strength  and  without  external  support.  Sometimes 
they  should  be  left  entirely  to  their  own  devices, 
that  they  may  not  be  spoilt  by  the  bad  habit  of 
always  relying  on  another's  efforts,  and  so  prove  in- 
capable of  effort  and  originality.  But  as  soon  as 
they  seem  to  have  acquired  a  sound  conception  of 
what  they  ought  to  say,  the  teacher's  work  will  be 
near  completion :  if  they  still  make  some  mistakes, 
they  must  be  brought  back  under  his  guidance.  We 
may  draw  a  lesson  from  the  birds  of  the  air,  whom 
we  see  distributing  the  food  which  they  have  col- 
lected in  their  bills  among  their  weak  and  helpless 
nestlings ;  but  as  soon  as  they  are  fledged,  we  see 
them  teaching  their  young  to  leave  the  nest  and  fly 
round  about  it,  themselves  leading  the  way ;  finally, 
when  they  have  proved  their  strength,  they  are  given 
the  freedom  of  the  open  sky  and  left  to  trust  in 
themselves. 

VII.  There  is  one  practice  at  present  in  vogue 
for  boys  of  the  age  under  discussion,  which  ought 
in  my  opinion  undoubtedly  to  be  changed.  They 
should  not  be  forced  to  commit  all  their  own  com- 
positions to  memory  and  to  deliver  them  on  an 
appointed  day,  as  is  at  present  the  custom.  This 
practice  is  especially  popular  with  the  boys'  fathers, 
who  think  that  their  sons  are  not  really  studying 
unless  they  declaim  on  every  possible  occasion, 
although  as  a  matter  of  fact  progress  depends

mainly  on  industry.  For  though  I  strongly  ap-  2 
prove  of  boys  writing  compositions  and  would  have 
them  spend  as  much  time  as  possible  over  such 
tasks,  I  had  much  rather  that  for  the  purpose  of 
learning  by  heart  passages  should  be  selected  from 
the  orators  or  historians  or  any  other  works  that 
may  be  deserving  of  such  attention.  For  it  is  a  3 
better  exercise  for  the  memory  to  learn  the  words 
of  others  than  it  is  to  learn  one's  own,  and  those 
who  have  practised  this  far  harder  task  will  find 
no  difficulty  in  committing  to  memory  their  own 
compositions  with  which  they  are  already  familiar. 
Further  they  will  form  an  intimate  acquaintance 
with  the  best  writings,  will  carry  their  models 
with  them  and  unconsciously  reproduce  the  style 
of  the  speech  which  has  been  impressed  upon  the 
memory.  They  will  have  a  plentiful  and  choice  4 
vocabulary  and  a  command  of  artistic  structure  and 
a  supply  of  figures  which  will  not  have  to  be 
hunted  for,  but  will  offer  themselves  spontane- 
ously from  the  treasure-house,  if  I  may  so  call  it, 
in  which  they  are  stored.  In  addition  they  will 
be  in  the  agreeable  position  of  being  able  to 
quote  the  happy  sayings  of  the  various  authors,  a 
power  which  they  will  find  most  useful  in  the 
courts.  For  phrases  which  have  not  been  coined 
merely  to  suit  the  circumstances  of  the  lawsuit  of 
the  moment  carry  greater  weight  and  often  win 
greater  praise  than  if  they  were  our  own.  I  5 
would  however  allow  boys  occasionally  to  declaim 
their  own  compositions  that  they  may  reap  the  re- 
ward of  their  labours  in  the  applause  of  a  large 
audience,  that  most  coveted  of  all  prizes.  But  this 
should  not  be  permitted  until  they  have  produced

something  more  finished  than  usual  :  they  will  thus 
be  rewarded  for  their  industry  and  rejoice  in  the 
thought  that  the  privilege  accorded  them  is  the 
recompense  of  merit. 

VIII.   It  is  generally  and  not  unreasonably  regarded 
as  the  sign  of  a  good  teacher  that  he  should  be  able 
to  differentiate  between  the  abilities  of  his  respective 
pupils  and  to  know  their  natural  bent.     The  gifts  of 
nature  are  infinite  in  their  variety,  and  mind  differs 
from  mind  almost  as  much  as  body  from  body.     This  2 
is  clear  from  a  consideration  of  the  orators  them- 
selves, who  differ  in  style  to  such  an  extent  that  no 
one  is  like  another,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  numbers 
have  modelled  their  style   on  that  of  their  favorite 
authors.      Many  again  think  it  useful  to  direct  their  3 
instruction  to  the  fostering  of  natural  advantages  and 
to  guide  the  talents  of  their  pupils  along  the  lines 
which  they  instinctively  tend  to  follow.     Just  as  an 
expert  gymnast,  when  he  enters  a  gymnasium  full  of 
boys,  after  testing  body  and  mind  in  every  way,  is 
able  to  decide  for  what  class  of  athletic  contest  they 
should  be  trained,  even  so,  they  say,  a  teacher  of  4 
oratory  after  careful  observation  of  a  boy's  stylistic 
preferences,  be  they  for  terseness  and  polish,  energy, 
dignity,  charm,   roughness,  brilliance  or  wit,  will  so 
adapt  his  instructions  to  individual  needs  that  each 
pupil  will  be  pushed  forward  in  the  sphere  for  which 
his  talents  seem  specially  to  design  him ;  for  nature,  5 
when    cultivated,    goes    from    strength  to  strength, 
while  he  who  runs  counter  to  her  bent  is  ineffective 
in  those   branches  of  the   art  for  which  he  is  less 
suited  and   weakens  the   talents   which  he  seemed 
born    to    employ.       Now,    since    the    critic    who    is  6 
guided   by  his  reason  is  free  to  dissent  even  from

received  opinions,  I  must  insist  that  to  my  think- 
ing this  view  is  only  partially  true.  It  is  un- 
doubtedly necessary  to  note  the  individual  gifts  of 
each  boy,  and  no  one  would  ever  convince  me  7 
that  it  is  not  desirable  to  differentiate  courses  of 
study  with  this  in  view.  One  boy  will  be  better 
adapted  for  the  study  of  history,  another  for  poetry, 
another  for  law,  while  some  perhaps  had  better  be 
packed  off  to  the  country.  The  teacher  of  rhetoric 
will  distinguish  such  special  aptitudes,  just  as  our 
gymnast  will  turn  one  pupil  into  a  runner,  another 
into  a  boxer  or  wrestler  or  an  expert  at  some  other 
of  the  athletic  accomplishments  for  which  prizes  are 
awarded  at  the  sacred  games.  But  on  the  other  8 
hand,  he  who  is  destined  for  the  bar  must  study  not 
one  department  merely,  but  must  perfect  himself  in 
all  the  accomplishments  which  his  profession  de- 
mands, even  though  some  of  them  may  seem  too  hard 
for  him  when  he  approaches  them  as  a  learner.  For  if 
natural  talent  alone  were  sufficient,  education  might 
be  dispensed  with.  Suppose  we  are  given  a  pupil  9 
who,  like  so  many,  is  of  depraved  tastes  and  swollen 
with  his  own  conceit ;  shall  we  suffer  him  to  go  his 
own  sweet  way  ?  If  a  boy's  disposition  is  naturally 
dry  and  jejune,  ought  we  not  to  feed  it  up  or  at  any 
rate  clothe  it  in  fairer  apparel  ?  For,  if  in  some  cases 
it  is  necessary  to  remove  certain  qualities,  surely 
there  are  others  where  we  may  be  permitted  to  add 
what  is  lacking.  Not  that  I  would  set  myself  against  10 
the  will  of  nature.  No  innate  good  quality  should  be 
neglected,  but  defects  must  be  made  good  and  weak- 
nesses made  strong.  When  Isocrates,  the  prince  of  11 
instructors,  whose  works  proclaim  his  eloquence  no 
less  than  his  pupils  testify  to  his  excellence  as  a

teacher,  gave  his  opinion  of  Ephorus  and  Theopompus 
to  the  effect  that  the  former  needed  the  spur  and  the 
latter  the  curb,  what  was  his  meaning?  Surely  not 
that  the  sluggish  temperament  of  the  one  and  the 
headlong  ardour  of  the  other  alike  required  modifi- 
cation by  instruction,  but  rather  that  each  would  gain 
from  an  admixture  of  the  qualities  of  the  other. 

In  the  case  of  weaker  understandings  however  some  12 

o 

concession  must  be  made  and  thev  should  be  directed 

•/ 

merely  to  follow  the  call  of  their  nature,  since  thus 
they  will  be  more  effective  in  doing  the  only  thing 
that  lies  in  their  power.  But  if  we  are  fortunate 
enough  to  meet  with  richer  material,  such  as  justifies 
us  in  the  hope  of  producing  a  real  orator,  we  must 
leave  no  oratorical  virtue  uncared  for.  For  though  he  13 
will  necessarily  have  a  natural  bent  for  some  special 
department  of  oratory,  he  will  not  feel  repelled  by 
the  others,  and  by  sheer  application  will  develop  his 
other  qualities  until  they  equal  those  in  which  he 
naturally  excels.  The  skilled  gymnast  will  once  again 
provide  us  with  a  parallel :  if  he  undertakes  to  train 
a  pancratiast,1  he  will  not  merely  teach  him  how 
to  use  his  fists  or  his  heels,  nor  will  he  restrict 
his  instructions  to  the  holds  in  wrestling,  giving 
special  attention  to  certain  tricks  of  this  kind, 
but  will  train  him  in  every  department  of  the 
science.  Some  will  no  doubt  be  incapable  of  at- 
taining proficiency  in  certain  exercises  ;  these  must 
specialise  on  those  which  lie  within  their  powers. 
For  there  are  two  things  which  he  must  be  most  14 
careful  to  avoid  :  first,  he  must  not  attempt  the  im- 
possible, secondly  he  must  not  switch  off  his  pupil 
from  what  he  can  do  well  to  exercises  for  which  he  is 
less  well  suited.  But  if  his  pupil  is  like  the  famous

Nicostratus,  whom  we  saw  when  he  was  old  and  we 
were  boys,  he  will  train  him  equally  in  every  depart- 
ment of  the  science  and  will  make  him  a  champion 
both  in  boxing  and  wrestling,,  like  Nicostratus  himself 
who  won  the  prize  for  both  contests  within  a  few  days 
of  each  other.  And  how  much  more  important  is  the  13 
employment  of  such  methods  where  our  future  orator 
is  concerned !  It  is  not  enough  to  be  able  to  speak 
with  terseness,  subtlety  or  vehemence,  any  more  than 
it  would  be  for  a  singing  master  to  excel  in  the  upper, 
middle  or  lower  register  only,  or  in  particular  sections 
of  these  registers  alone.  Eloquence  is  like  a  harp 
and  will  never  reach  perfection,  unless  all  its  strings 
be  taut  and  in  tune. 

IX.  Though  I  have  spoken  in  some  detail  of  the 
duties  of  the  teacher,  I  shall  for  the  moment  confine 
my  advice  to  the  learners  to  one  solitary  admonition, 
that  they  should  love  their  masters  not  less  than 
their  studies,  and  should  regard  them  as  the  parents 
not  indeed  of  their  bodies  but  of  their  minds.  Such  2 
attachments  are  of  invaluable  assistance  to  study. 
For  under  their  influence  they  find  it  a  pleasure  to 
listen  to  Iheir  teachers,  believe  what  they  say  and 
Ions;  to  be  like  them,  come  cheerfully  and  gladly  to

school,  are  not  angry  when  corrected,  rejoice  when 
praised,  and  seek  to  win  their  master's  affection  by 
the  devotion  with  which  they  pursue  their  studies. 
For  as  it  is  the  duty  of  the  master  to  teach,  so  it  is  3 
the  duty  of  the  pupil  to  show  himself  teachable.  The 
two  obligations  are  mutually  indispensable.  And  just 
as  it  takes  two  parents  to  produce  a  human  being, 
and  as  the  seed  is  scattered  in  vain,  if  the  ground  is 
hard  and  there  is  no  furrow  to  receive  it  and  bring  it 
to  growth,  even  so  eloquence  can  never  come  to

maturity,  unless  teacher  and  taught  are  in  perfect 
sympathy. 

X.  These  elementary  stages  aio  in  themselves 
no  small  undertaking,  but  they  are  merely  members 
and  portions  of  the  greater  whole  ;  when  therefore 
the  pupil  has  been  thoroughly  instructed  and  exer- 
cised in  these  departments,  the  time  will  as  a  rule 
have  come  for  him  to  attempt  deliberative  and 
forensic  themes.  But  before  I  begin  to  discuss 
these,,  I  must  say  a  few  words  on  the  theory  of 
declamation,  which  is  at  once  the  most  recent  and 
most  useful  of  rhetorical  exercises.  For  it  includes  2 
practically  all  the  exercises  of  which  we  have  been 
speaking  and  is  in  close  touch  with  reality.  As  a 
result  it  has  acquired  such  a  vogue  that  many  think 
that  it  is  the  sole  training  necessary  to  the  formation 
of  an  orator,  since  there  is  no  excellence  in  a  formal 
speech  which  is  not  also  to  be  found  in  this  type  of 
rhetorical  exercise.  On  the  other  hand  the  actual  3 
practice  of  declamation  has  degenerated  to  such  an 
extent  owing  to  the  fault  of  our  teachers,  that  it  has 
come  to  be  one  of  the  chief  causes  of  the  corruption 
of  modern  oratory  ;  such  is  the  extravagance  and 
ignorance  of  our  declaimers.  But  it  is  possible  to 
make  a  sound  use  of  anything  that  is  naturally  sound. 
The  subjects  chosen  for  themes  should,  therefore,  be  4 
as  true  to  life  as  possible,  and  the  actual  declamation 
should,  as  far  as  may  be,  be  modelled  on  the  plead- 
ings for  which  it  was  devised  as  a  training.  For  we  5 
shall  hunt  in  vain  among  sponsions1  and  interdicts 
for  magicians  and  plagues  and  oracles  and  step- 
mothers more  cruel  than  any  in  tragedy,  and  other 

commanding   or   prohibiting    certain   action.      It    occurred 
chiefly  in  disputes  about  property.

subjects  still  more  unreal  than  these.1  What  then? 
are  we  never  to  permit  young  men  to  handle  unreal 
or,  to  be  more  accurate,  poetic  themes  that  they  may 
run  riot  and  exult  in  their  strength  and  display  their 
full  stature?  It  were  best  to  prohibit  them  absolutely.  6 
But  at  any  rate  the  themes,  however  swelling  and 
magnificent,  should  not  be  such  as  to  seem  foolish 

c3  * 

and  laughable  to  the  eye  of  an  intelligent  observer. 
Consequently,  if  we  must  make  some  concession,  let 
us  allow  the  declaimer  to  gorge  himself  occasion- 
ally, as  long  as  he  realises  that  his  case  will  be  like 
that  of  cattle  that  have  blown  themselves  out  with  a 
surfeit  of  green  food  :  they  are  cured  of  their  disorder 
by  blood-letting  and  then  put  back  to  food  such  as 
will  maintain  their  strength;  similarly  the  declaimer 
must  be  rid  of  his  superfluous  fat,  and  his  corrupt 
humours  must  be  discharged,  if  he  wants  to  be 
strong  and  healthy.  Otherwise,  the  first  time  he  7 

O  J  f 

makes  any  serious  effort,  his  swollen  emptiness  will 
stand  revealed.  Those,  however,  who  hold  that 
declamation  has  absolutely  nothing  in  common  with 
pleading  in  the  courts,  are  clearly  quite  unaware  of 
the  reasons  which  gave  rise  to  this  type  of  exercise. 
For  if  declamation  is  not  a  preparation  for  the  actual  8 
work  of  the  courts,  it  can  only  be  compared  to  the 
rant  of  an  actor  or  the  raving  of  a  lunatic.  For  what 
is  the  use  of  attempting  to  conciliate  a  non-existent 
judge,  or  of  stating  a  case  which  all  know  to  be 
false,  or  of  trying  to  prove  a  point  on  which  judg- 
ment will  never  be  passed?  Such  waste  of  effort 
is,  however,  a  comparative  trifle.  But  what  can  be 
more  ludicrous  than  to  work  oneself  into  a  passion 
and  to  attempt  to  excite  the  anger  or  grief  of 
our  hearers,  unless  we  are  preparing  ourselves  by

such  mimic  combats  for  the  actual  strife  and  the 
pitched  battles  of  the  law-courts  ?  Is  there  then  no  9 
difference  between  our  declamations  and  genuine 
forensic  oratory?  I  can  only  reply,  that  if  we  speak 
with  a  desire  for  improvement,  there  will  be  no 
difference.  I  wish  indeed  that  certain  additions 
could  be  made  to  the  existing  practice  ;  that  we  made 
use  of  names,  that  our  fictitious  debates  dealt  with 
more  complicated  cases  and  sometimes  took  longer 
to  deliver,  that  we  were  less  afraid  of  words  drawn 
from  everyday  speech  and  that  we  were  in  the  habit 
of  seasoning  our  words  with  jests.  For  as  regards 
all  these  points,  we  are  mere  novices  when  we  come 
to  actual  pleading,  however  elaborate  the  training 
that  the  schools  have  given  us  on  other  points.  And  10 
even  if  display  is  the  object  of  declamation,  surely 
we  ought  to  unbend  a  little  for  the  entertainment  of 
our  audience.  For  even  in  those  speeches  which,  11 
although  undoubtedly  to  some  extent  concerned 
with  the  truth,  are  designed  to  charm  the  multi- 
tude (such  for  instance  as  panegyrics  and  the  oratory 
of  display  in  all  its  branches),  it  is  permissible  to 
be  more  ornate  and  not  merely  to  disclose  all  the 
resources  of  our  art,  which  in  cases  of  law  should  as 
a  rule  be  concealed,  but  actually  to  flaunt  them 
before  those  who  have  been  summoned  to  hear  us. 
Declamation  therefore  should  resemble  the  truth,  12 
since  it  is  modelled  on  forensic  and  deliberative 
oratory.  On  the  other  hand  it  also  involves  an 
element  of  display,  and  should  in  consequence 
assume  a  certain  air  of  elegance.  In  this  connexion  1? 
I  may  cite  the  practice  of  comic  actors,  whose  de- 
livery is  not  exactly  that  of  common  speech,  since 
that  would  be  inartistic,  but  is  on  the  other  hand  not

far  removed  from  the  accents  of  nature,  for,,  if  it  were, 
their  mimicry  would  be  a  failure:  what  they  do  there- 
fore is  to  exalt  the  simplicity  of  ordinary  speech 
by  a  touch  of  stage  decoration.  So  too  we  shall  14 
have  to  put  up  with  certain  inconveniences  arising 
from  the  nature  of  our  fictitious  themes  ;  such  draw- 
backs occur  more  especially  in  connexion  with  those 
numerous  details  which  are  left  uncertain  and  which 
we  presume  to  suit  our  purpose,  such  as  the  ages  of 
our  characters,  their  wealth,  their  families,  or  the 
strength,  laws  and  manners  of  the  cities  where  our 
scenes  are  laid,  and  the  like.  Sometimes  we  even  lo 
draw  arguments  from  the  actual  flaws  of  the  assump- 
tions involved  by  the  theme.  But  each  of  these 
points  shall  be  dealt  with  in  its  proper  place.  For 
although  the  whole  purpose  of  this  work  is  the 
formation  of  an  orator,  I  have  no  intention  of  passing 
over  anything  that  has  a  genuine  connexion  with  the 
practice  of  the  schools,  for  fear  that  students  may 
complain  of  the  omission. 

XI.  I  have  now  arrived  at  the  point  when  I  must 
begin  to  deal  with  that  portion  of  the  art  at  which 
those  who  have  omitted  the  preceding  stages  gener- 
ally commence.  I  can  see,  however,  that  certain 
critics  will  attempt  to  obstruct  my  path  at  the  very 
outset:  for  they  will  urge  that  eloquence  can  dis- 
pense with  rules  of  this  kind  and,  in  smug  satis- 
faction with  themselves  and  the  ordinary  methods 
and  exercises  of  the  schools,  will  laugh  at  me  for 
my  pains  ;  in  which  they  will  be  only  following  the 
example  of  certain  professors  of  no  small  reputation. 
One  of  these  gentlemen,  I  believe,  when  asked  to 
define  a  figure  and  a  thought,  replied  that  he  did  not 
know  what  they  were,  but  that,  if  they  had  anything

to  do  with  the  subject,  they  would  be  found  in 
his  declamation.  Another  when  asked  whether  he  2 
was  a  follower  of  Theodorusor  Apollodorus,  replied, 
"Oh!  as  for  me,  I  am  all  for  the  Thracians." 1 
To  do  him  justice,  he  could  hardly  have  found  a 
neater  way  to  avoid  confessing  his  ignorance.  These 
persons,  just  because,  thanks  to  their  natural  gifts, 
they  are  regarded  as  brilliant  performers  and  have, 
as  a  matter  of  fact,  uttered  much  that  deserves  to 
be  remembered,  think  that,  while  most  men  share 
their  careless  habits,  few  come  near  them  for  talent. 
Consequently  they  make  it  their  boast  that  they  3 
speak  on  impulse  and  owe  their  success  to  their 
native  powers ;  they  further  assert  that  there  is  no 
need  of  proof  or  careful  marshalling  of  facts  when 
we  are  speaking  on  fictitious  themes,  but  only  of 
some  of  those  sounding  epigrams,  the  expectation  of 
which  has  filled  the  lecture-room  ;  and  these  they 
say  are  best  improvised  on  the  spur  of  the  moment. 
Further,  owing  to  their  contempt  for  method,  when  4 
they  are  meditating  on  some  future  effusion,  they 
spend  whole  days  looking  at  the  ceiling  in  the  hope 
that  some  magnificent  inspiration  may  occur  to 
them,  or  rock  their  bodies  to  and  fro,  booming

inarticulately  as  if  they  had  a  trumpet  inside  them 
and  adapting  their  agitated  movements,  not  to  the 
delivery  of  the  words,  but  to  their  pursuit.  Some  5 
again  settle  on  certain  definite  openings  long  be- 
fore they  have  thought  what  they  are  going  to  say, 
with  a  view  to  using  them  as  pegs  for  subsequent 
snatches  of  eloquence,  and  then  after  practising 
their  delivery  first  in  silent  thought  and  then 
aloud  for  hours  together,  in  utter  desperation  of 
providing  any  connecting  links,  abandon  them  and

least  unreasonable  of  them  devote  their  atten- 
tion not  to  the  actual  cases,  but  to  their  purple 
patches,  in  the  composition  of  which  they  pay  no 
attention  to  the  subject-matter,  but  fire  off  a  series 
of  isolated  thoughts  just  as  they  happen  to  come  to 
hand.  The  result  is  a  speech  which,  being  com-  7 
posed  of  disconnected  passages  having  nothing  in 
common  with  each  other,  must  necessarily  lack 
cohesion  and  can  only  be  compared  to  a  schoolboy's 
notebook,  in  which  he  jots  down  any  passages  from 
the  declamations  of  others  that  have  come  in  for  a 
word  of  praise.  None  the  less  they  do  occasionally 
strike  out  some  good  things  and  some  fine  epigrams, 
such  as  they  make  their  boast.  Why  not  ?  slaves 
and  barbarians  sometimes  achieve  the  same  effects, 
and  if  we  are  to  be  satisfied  with  this  sort  of  thing, 
then  good-bye  to  any  theory  of  oratory. 

XII.  I  must,  however,  admit  that  the  general 
opinion  is  that  the  untrained  speaker  is  usually 
the  more  vigorous.  This  opinion  is  due  primarily 
to  the  erroneous  judgment  of  faulty  critics,  who 
think  that  true  vigour  is  all  the  greater  for  its  lack 
of  art,  regarding  it  as  a  special  proof  of  strength  to 
force  what  might  be  opened,  to  break  what  might 
be  untied  and  to  drag  what  might  be  led.  Even  a  2 
gladiator  who  plunges  into  the  fight  with  no  skill  at 
arms  to  help  him,  and  a  wrestler  who  puts  forth  the 
whole  strength  of  his  body  the  moment  he  has  got 
a  hold,  is  acclaimed  by  them  for  his  outstanding 
vigour,  although  it  is  of  frequent  occurrence  in  such 
cases  for  the  latter  to  be  overthrown  by  his  own 
strength  and  for  the  former  to  find  the  fury  of  his

onslaught  parried  by  his  adversary  with  a  supple 
turn  of  the  wrist.  But  there  are  many  details  in  this  3 
department  of  our  art  which  the  unskilled  critic  will 
never  notice.  For  instance,  careful  division  under 
heads,  although  of  the  utmost  importance  in  actual 
cases,  makes  the  outward  show  of  strength  seem 
less  than  the  reality;  the  unhewn  block  is  larger 
than  the  polished  marble,  and  things  when  scattered 
seem  more  numerous  than  when  placed  together. 
There  is  moreover  a  sort  of  resemblance  between  4 
certain  merits  and  certain  defects :  abuse  passes  for 
freedom  of  speech,  rashness  for  courage,  prodigality 
for  abundance.  But  the  untrained  advocate  will 
abuse  too  openly  and  too  often,  even  though  by  so 
doing  he  imperils  the  success  of  the  case  which  he 
has  undertaken  and  not  seldom  his  own  personal 
safety  as  well.  But  even  such  violence  will  win  5 
men's  good  opinion,  since  they  are  only  too  pleased 
to  hear  another  say  things  which  nothing  would 
have  induced  them  to  utter  themselves.  Such 
speakers  are  also  less  careful  to  avoid  that  other 
peril,  the  pitfall  of  style,  and  are  so  reckless  in  their 
efforts  that  sometimes  in  their  passion  for  extrava- 
gance they  light  upon  some  really  striking  expres- 
sion. But  such  success  is  rare  and  does  not 
compensate  for  their  other  defects. 

For  the  same  reason  the  uninstructed  sometimes  6 
appear  to  have  a  richer  flow  of  language,  because 
they  say  everything  that  can  be  said,  while  the 
learned  exercise  discrimination  and  self-restraint. 
To  this  must  be  added  the  fact  that  such  persons 
take  no  trouble  to  prove  their  contentions,  and 
consequently  steer  clear  of  the  chilly  reception 
given  in  our  decadent  law-courts  to  arguments  and

questions  and  seek  only  for  such  themes  as  may 
beguile  the  ears  of  the  public  even  at  the  cost  of 
appealing  to  the  most  perverted  tastes.  Again,  7 
their  epigrams,,  the  sole  objects  of  their  quest,  seem 
all  the  more  striking  because  of  the  dreariness  and 
squalor  of  their  context,  since  flashes  are  more 
clearly  seen  against  a  background,  not  of  mere 
"  shade,"  as  Cicero1  says,  but  of  pitchy  darkness. 
Well,  let  the  world  credit  them  with  as  much  genius 
as  it  pleases,  so  long  as  it  is  admitted  that  such 
praise  is  an  insult  to  any  man  of  real  eloquence. 
None  the  less  it  must  be  confessed  that  learning  8 
does  take  something  from  oratory,  just  as  the  file 
takes  something  from  rough  surfaces  or  the  whet- 
stone from  blunt  edges  or  age  from  wine  ;  it  takes 
away  defects,  and  if  the  results  produced  after  sub- 
jection to  the  polish  of  literary  study  are  less,  they 
are  less  only  because  they  are  better. 

But  these  creatures  have  another  weapon  in  their  9 
armoury  :  they  seek  to  obtain  the  reputation  of 
speaking  with  greater  vigour  than  the  trained  orator 
by  means  of  their  delivery.  For  they  shout  on  all 
and  every  occasion  and  bellow  their  every  utterance 
"with  uplifted  hand,"  to  use  their  own  phrase, 
dashing  this  way  and  that,  panting,  gesticulating 
wildly  and  wagging  their  heads  with  all  the  frenzy 
of  a  lunatic.  Smite  your  hands  together,  stamp  10 
the  ground,  slap  your  thigh,  your  breast,  your  fore- 
head, and  you  will  go  straight  to  the  heart  of  the 
dingier  members  of  your  audience.2  But  the  edu- 
cated speaker,  just  as  he  knows  how  to  moderate 
his  style,  and  to  impart  variety  and  artistic  form  to 
his  speech,  is  an  equal  adept  in  the  matter  of  de- 
livery and  will  suit  his  action  to  the  tone  of  each

canon  for  universal  observance,,  it  is  that  he  should 
both  possess  the  reality  and  present  the  appearance 
of  self-control.  But  the  ranters  confer  the  title  of  11 
force  on  that  which  is  really  violence.  You  may 
also  occasionally  find  not  merely  pleaders,  but,  what 
is  far  more  shameful,  teachers  as  well,  who,  after  a 
brief  training  in  the  art  of  speaking,  throw  method 
to  the  winds  and,  yielding  to  the  impulse  of  the 
moment,  run  riot  in  every  direction,  abusing  those 
who  hold  literature  in  higher  respect  as  fools  with- 
out life,  courage  or  vigour,  and  calling  them  the 
first  and  worst  name  that  occurs  to  them.  Still  let  12 
me  congratulate  these  gentlemen  on  attaining  elo- 
quence without  industry,  method  or  studv.  As  for 
myself  I  have  long  since  retired  from  the  task  of 
teaching,  in  the  schools  and  of  speaking  in  the 
courts,  thinking  it  the  most  honourable  conclusion  to 
retire  while  my  services  were  still  in  request,  and  all 
I  ask  is  to  be  allowed  to  console  my  leisure  by 
making  such  researches  and  composing  such  instruc- 
tions as  will,  I  hope,  prove  useful  to  young  men  of 
ability,  and  are,  at  any  rate,  a  pleasure  to  myself. 
XIII.  Let  no  one  however  demand  from  me  a  rigid 

O 

code  of  rules  such  as  most  authors  of  textbooks  have 
laid  down,  or  ask  me  to  impose  on  students  of  rhe- 
toric a  system  of  laws  immutable  as  fate,  a  system  in 
which  injunctions  as  to  the  exordium  and  its  nature 
lead  the  way;  then  come  the  statement  of  facts  and 
the  laws  to  be  observed  in  this  connexion  :  next  the 
proposition  or,  as  some  prefer,  the  digression,  followed 
by  prescriptions  as  to  the  order  in  which  the  various 
questions  should  be  discussed,  with  all  the  other  rules, 
which  some  speakers  follow  as  though  they  had  no

causis,    temporibus,    occasione,    necessitate.      Atque 
ideo    res    in   oratore    praecipua    consilium    est,  quia 

3  varie  et  ad  reruin  momenta   convertitur.      Quid   si

choice  but  to  regard  them  as  orders  and  as  if  it  were 
a  crime  to  take  any  other  line.  If  the  whole  of  rhe-  2 
toric  could  be  thus  embodied  in  one  compact  code, 
it  would  be  an  easy  task  of  little  compass :  but 
most  rules  are  liable  to  be  altered  by  the  nature  of 
the  case,  circumstances  of  time  and  place,  and  by 
hard  necessity  itself.  Consequently  the  all-important 
gift  for  an  orator  is  a  wise  adaptability  since  he  is 
called  upon  to  meet  the  most  varied  emergencies. 
What  if  you  should  instruct  a  general,  as  often  as  he  3 
marshals  his  troops  for  battle,  to  draw  up  his  front  in 
line,  advance  his  wings  to  left  and  right,  and  station 
his  cavalry  to  protect  his  flank?  This  will  perhaps  be 
the  best  plan,  if  circumstances  allow.  But  it  may 
have  to  be  modified  owing  to  the  nature  of  the  ground, 
if,  for  instance,  he  is  confronted  by  a  mountain,  if  a 
river  bars  his  advance,  or  his  movements  are  hampered 
by  hills,  woods  or  broken  country.  Or  again  it  may  4 
be  modified  by  the  character  of  the  enemy  or  the 
nature  of  the  crisis  by  which  he  is  faced.  On  one 
occasion  he  will  fight  in  line,  on  another  in  column, 
on  one  he  will  use  his  auxiliary  troops,  on  another  his 
legionaries  ;  while  occasionally  a  feint  of  flight  may 
win  the  day.  So,  too,  with  the  rules  of  oratory.  Is  5 
the  exordium  necessary  or  superfluous?  should  it  be 
long  or  short  ?  addressed  entirely  to  the  judge  or 
sometimes  directed  to  some  other  quarter  by  the 
employment  of  some  figure  of  speech  ? l  Should  the 
statement  of  facts  be  concise  or  developed  at  some 
length  ?  continuous  or  divided  into  sections  ?  and 
should  it  follow  the  actual  or  an  artificial  order  of 
events  ?  The  orator  will  find  the  answers  to  all  these 
questions  in  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  So,  too, 
with  the  order  in  which  questions  should  be  discussed,

since  in  any  given  debate  it  may  often  suit  one  party  6 
best  that  such  and  such  a  question  come  up  first, 
while  their  opponents  would  be  best  suited  by  another. 
For  these  rules  have  not  the  formal  authority  of  laws 
or  decrees  of  the  plebs,  but  are,  with  all  they  contain, 
the  children  of  expediency.  I  will  not  deny  that  it  7 
is  generally  expedient  to  conform  to  such  rules,  other- 
wise I  should  not  be  writing  now  ;  but  if  our  friend 
expediency  suggests  some  other  course  to  us,  why, 
we  shall  disregard  the  authority  of  the  professors 
and  follow  her. 

For  my  part  above  all  things  8 

"This  I  enjoin  and  urge  and  urge  anew  "  1 

that  in  all  his  pleadings  the  orator  should  keep  two 
things  constantly  in  view,  what  is  becoming  and  what 
is  expedient.  But  it  is  often  expedient  and  occa- 
sionally becoming  to  make  some  modification  in  the 
time-honoured  order.  We  see  the  same  thing  in 
pictures  and  statues.  Dress,  expression  and  attitude 
are  frequently  varied.  The  body  when  held  bolt  9 
upright  has  but  little  grace,  for  the  face  looks  straight 
forward,  the  arms  hang  by  the  side,  the  feet  are 
joined  and  the  whole  figure  is  stiff  from  top  to  toe. 
But  that  curve,  I  might  almost  call  it  motion,  with 
which  we  are  so  familiar,  gives  an  impression  of  action 
and  animation.  So,  too,  the  hands  will  not  always  be 
represented  in  the  same  position,  and  the  variety 
given  to  the  expression  will  be  infinite.  Some  figures  10 
are  represented  as  running  or  rushing  forward,  others 
sit  or  recline,  some  are  nude,  others  clothed,  while 
some  again  are  half-dressed,  half-naked.  Where  can 
we  find  a  more  violent  and  elaborate  attitude  than 
that  of  the  Discobolus  of  Myron  ?  Yet  the  critic  who

disapproved  of  the  figure  because  it  was  not  upright, 
would  merely  show  his  utter  failure  to  understand  the 
sculptor's  art,  in  which  the  very  novelty  and  difficulty 
of  execution  is  what  most  deserves  our  praise.  A  11 
similar  impression  of  grace  and  charm  is  produced  by 
rhetorical  figures,  whether  they  be  figures  of  thought 
or  fgures  of  speech.  For  they  involve  a  certain  de- 
parture from  the  straight  line  and  have  the  merit  of 
variation  from  the  ordinary  usage.  In  a  picture  the  12 
full  face  is  most  attractive.  But  Apelles  painted 
Antigonus  in  profile,  to  conceal  the  blemish  caused 
by  the  loss  of  one  eye.  So,  too,  in  speaking,  there 
are  certain  things  which  have  to  be  concealed,  either 
because  they  ought  not  to  be  disclosed  or  because 
they  cannot  be  expressed  as  they  deserve.  Timanthes,  13 
who  was,  1  think,  a  native  of  Cythnus,  provides  an 
example  of  this  in  the  picture  with  which  he  won  the 
victory  over  Colotes  of  Teos.  It  represented  the 
sacrifice  of  Iphigenia,  and  the  artist  had  depicted  an 
expression  of  grief  on  the  face  of  Calchas  and  of  still 
greater  grief  on  that  of  Ulysses,  while  he  had  given 
Menelaus  an  agony  of  sorrow  beyond  which  his  art 
could  not  go.  Having  exhausted  his  powers  of  emo- 
tional expression  he  was  at  a  loss  to  portray  the 
father's  face  as  it  deserved,  and  solved  the  problem 
by  veiling  his  head  and  leaving  his  sorrow  to  the 
imagination  of  the  spectator.  Sallust1  did  some-  14 
thing  similar  when  he  wrote  "I  think  it  better  to  say 

c^  * 

nothing  of  Carthage  rather  than  say  too  little."  It 
has  always,  therefore,  been  my  custom  not  to  tie  my- 
self down  to  universal  or  general  rules  (this  being  the 
nearest  equivalent  I  can  find  for  the  Greek  catholic 
rules}.  For  rules  are  rarely  of  such  a  kind  that  their 
validity  cannot  be  shaken  and  overthrown  in  some

particular  or  other.  But  I  must  reserve  each  of  these  15 
points  for  fuller  treatment  in  its  proper  place.  For 
the  present  I  will  only  say  that  I  do  not  want  young 
men  to  think  their  education  complete  when  they 
have  mastered  one  of  the  small  text-books  of  which 
so  many  are  in  circulation,  or  to  ascribe  a  talismanic 
value  to  the  arbitrary  decrees  of  theorists.  The  art 
of  speaking  can  only  be  attained  by  hard  work  and 
assiduity  of  study,  by  a  variety  of  exercises  and  re- 
peated trial,  the  highest  prudence  and  unfailing 
quickness  of  judgement.  But  rules  are  helpful  all  the  16 
same  so  long  as  they  indicate  the  direct  road  and  do 

• 

not  restrict  us  absolutely  to  the  ruts  made  by  others. 
For  he  who  thinks  it  an  unpardonable  sin  to  leave  the 
old,  old  track,  must  be  content  to  move  at  much  the 
same  speed  as  a  tight-rope  walker.  Thus,  for  example, 
we  often  leave  a  paved  military  road  to  take  a  short 
cut  or,  finding  that  the  direct  route  is  impossible 
owing  to  floods  having  broken  down  the  bridges,  are 
forced  to  make  a  circuit,  while  if  our  house  is  on  fire 
and  flames  bar  the  way  to  the  front  door,  we  make 
our  escape  by  breaking  through  a  party  wall.  The  17 
orator's  task  covers  a  large  ground,  is  extremely 
varied  and  develops  some  new  aspect  almost  every 
day,  so  that  the  last  word  on  the  subject  will  never 
have  been  said.  I  shall  however  try  to  set  forth  the 
traditional  rules  and  to  point  out  their  best  features, 
mentioning  the  changes,  additions  and  subtractions 
which  seem  desirable. 

XIV.  Rhetoric  is  a  Greek  term  which  has  been 
translated  into  Latin  by  oratorio,  or  oratrix.  I  would 
not  for  the  world  deprive  the  translators  of  the 
praise  which  is  their  due  for  attempting  to  increase 
the  vocabulary  of  our  native  tongue;  but  translations

from  Greek  into  Latin  are  not  always  satisfactory, 
just  as  the  attempt  to  represent  Latin  words 
in  a  Greek  dress  is  sometimes  equally  unsuccessful. 
And  the  translations  in  question  are  fully  as  2 
harsh  as  the  essentia  and  queentia l  of  Plautus,2 
and  have  not  even  the  merit  of  being  exact. 
For  oratorio,  is  formed  like  elocutoria  and  oratrix 
like  elocutrix,  whereas  the  rhetoric  with  which 
we  are  concerned  is  rather  to  be  identified  with 
eloquentia,  and  the  word  is  undoubtedly  used  in  two 
senses  by  the  Greeks.  In  the  one  case  it  is  an  3 
adjective  i.e.  ars  rhelorica,  the  rhetorical  art,  like 
piratic  in  the  phrase  nauis  piratic  a,  in  the  other  it  is 
a  noun  like  philosophy  or  friendship.  It  is  as  a  sub- 
stantive that  we  require  it  here  ;  now  the  correct 
translation  of  the  Greek  grammatice  is  litteratura  not 
litteralrix  or  litteratoria,  which  would  be  the  forms 
analogous  to  oratrix  and  oratoria.  But  in  the  case  of 
"  rhetoric  "  there  is  no  similar  Latin  equivalent.  It  is  4 
best  therefore  not  to  quarrel  about  it,  more  especially 
as  we  have  to  use  Greek  terms  in  many  other  cases. 
For  I  may  at  least  use  the  words  philosophies,  musicus 
and  geomctres  without  outraging  them  by  changing 
them  into  clumsy  Latin  equivalents.  Finally, 
since  Cicero  gave  a  Greek  title  3  to  the  earlier  works 
which  he  wrote  on  this  subject,  I  may  without  fear 
of  rashness  accept  the  great  orator  as  sufficient 
authority  for  the  name  of  the  art  which  he  pro- 
fessed. 

To  resume,  then,  rhetoric  (for  I  shall  now  use  the   6 
name  without   fear  of   captious   criticism)  is  in  my 
opinion  best  treated  under  the  three  following  heads, 
the  art,  the  artist  and  the  work.     The  art  is  that 
which  we  should  acquire  by  study,  and  is  the  art  of

speaking  well.  The  artist  is  he  who  has  acquired  the 
art,  that  is  to  say,  he  is  the  orator  whose  task  it  is 
to  speak  well.  The  work  is  the  achievement  of 
the  artist,  namely  good  speaking.  Each  of  these 
three  general  divisions  is  in  its  turn  divided  into 
species.  Of  the  two  latter  divisions  I  shall  speak 
in  their  proper  place.  For  the  present  I  shall  pro- 
ceed to  a  discussion  of  the  first. 

XV.  The  first  question  which  confronts  us  is 
"  What  is  rhetoric  ?  "  Many  definitions  have  been 
given  ;  but  the  problem  is  really  twofold.  For  the 
dispute  turns  either  on  the  quality  of  the  thing 
itself  or  on  the  meaning  of  the  words  in  which  it 
is  defined.  The  first  and  chief  disagreement  on  the 
subject  is  found  in  the  fact  that  some  think  that 
even  bad  men  may  be  called  orators,  while  others, 
of  whom  I  am  one,  restrict  the  name  of  orator  and 
the  art  itself  to  those  who  are  good.  Of  those  who 
divorce  eloquence  from  that  yet  fairer  and  more  de- 
sirable title  to  renown,  a  virtuous  life,  some  call 
rhetoric  merely  a  power,  some  a  science,  but  not  a 
virtue,  some  a  practice,  some  an  art,  though  they  will 
not  allow  the  art  to  have  anything  in  common  with 
science  or  virtue,  while  some  again  call  it  a  perver- 
sion of  art  or  Ka/corexvia.  These  persons  have  as  a 
rule  held  that  the  task  of  oratory  lies  in  persuasion 
or  speaking  in  a  persuasive  manner :  for  this  is 
within  the  power  of  a  bad  man  no  less  than  a  good. 
Hence  we  get  the  common  definition  of  rhetoric  as 
the  power  of  persuading.  What  I  call  a  power, 
many  call  a  capacity,  and  some  a  faculty.  In  order 
therefore  that  there  may  be  no  misunderstanding  I 
will  say  that  by  power  I  mean  Swa/xis.  This  view 
is  derived  from  Isocrates,  if  indeed  the  treatise  on

rhetoric  l  which  circulates  under  his  name  is  really 
from  his  hand.  He,  although  far  from  agreeing 
with  those  whose  aim  is  to  disparage  the  duties  of 
an  orator,  somewhat  rashly  defined  rhetoric  as 
7ra$ot'5  Bri/jiiovp-yos,  the  "worker  of  persuasion":  for 
I  cannot  bring  myself  to  use  the  peculiar  derivative 
which  Ennius 2  applies  to  Marcus  Cethegus  in  the 
phrase  suadae  medulla,  the  "marrow  of  persuasion." 
Again  Gorgias,3  in  the  dialogue  of  Plato  that  takes  5 
its  title  from  his  name,  says  practically  the  same 
thing,  but  Plato  intends  it  to  be  taken  as  the  opinion 
of  Gorgias,  not  as  his  own.  Cicero  4  in  more  than 
one  passage  defined  the  duty  of  an  orator  as  "speak- 
ing in  a  persuasive  manner."  In  his  Rhetoricab  too,  6 
a  work  which  it  is  clear  gave  him  no  satisfaction,  he 
makes  the  end  to  be  persuasion.  But  many  other 
things  have  the  power  of  persuasion,  such  as  money, 
influence,  the  authority  and  rank  of  the  speaker,  or 
even  some  sight  unsupported  by  language,  when 
for  instance  the  place  of  words  is  supplied  by  the 
memory  of  some  individual's  great  deeds,  by  his 
lamentable  appearance  or  the  beauty  of  his  person. 
Thus  when  Antonius  in  the  course  of  his  defence  of  7 
Manius  Aquilius  tore  open  his  client's  robe  and  re- 
vealed the  honourable  scars  which  he  had  acquired 
while  facing  his  country's  foes,  he  relied  no  longer 
on  the  power  of  his  eloquence,  but  appealed  directly 
to  the  eyes  of  the  Roman  people.  And  it  is  believed 
that  they  were  so  profoundly  moved  by  the  sight  as 
to  acquit  the  accused.  Again  there  is  a  speech  of  8 
Cato,  to  mention  no  other  records,  which  informs  us 
that  Servius  Galba  escaped  condemnation  solely  by 

B  cp.  m.  i.  20  and  Cic.  de  Or.  I.  ii.  5.     The  work  in  question 
is  better  known  as  the  de  Inventione.

the  pit}7  which  he  aroused  not  only  by  producing  his 
own  young  children  before  the  assembly,  but  by 
carrying  round  in  his  arms  the  son  of  Sulpicius 
Gallus.  So  also  according  to  general  opinion  Phryne  9 
was  saved  not  by  the  eloquence  of  Hyperides,  ad- 
mirable as  it  was,  but  by  the  sight  of  her  exquisite 
body,  which  she  further  revealed  by  drawing  aside 
her  tunic.  And  if  all  these  have  power  to  per- 
suade, the  end  of  oratory,  which  we  are  discussing, 
cannot  adequately  be  denned  as  persuasion.  Con-  10 
sequently  those  who,  although  holding  the  same 
general  view  of  rhetoric,  have  regarded  it  as  the 
power  of  persuasion  by  speaking,  pride  themselves  on 
their  greater  exactness  of  language.  This  definition 
is  given  by  Gorgias,  in  the  dialogue l  mentioned 
above,  under  compulsion  from  the  inexorable  logic  of 
Socrates.  Theodectes  agrees  with  him,  whether  the 
treatise  on  rhetoric  which  has  come  down  to  us 
under  his  name  is  really  by  him  or,  as  is  generally 
believed,  by  Aristotle.  In  that  work  the  end  of 
rhetoric  is  defined  as  the  leading  of  men  by  the 
power  of  speech  to  the  conclusioji  desired  by  the  orator. 
But  even  this  definition  is  not  sufficiently  compre-  11 
iiensive,  since  others  besides  orators  persuade  by 
speaking  or  lead  others  to  the  conclusion  desired,  as 
for  example  harlots,  flatterers  and  seducers.  On 
the  other  hand  the  orator  is  not  always  engaged  on 
persuasion,  so  that  sometimes  persuasion  is  not  his 
special  object,  while  sometimes  it  is  shared  by 
others  who  are  far  removed  from  being  orators.  And  12 
yet  Apollodorus  is  not  very  far  off  this  definition 
when  he  asserts  that  the  first  and  all-important  task 
of  forensic  oratory  is  to  persuade  the  judge  and  lead 
his  mind  to  the  conclusions  desired  by  the  speaker.  For

even  Apollodorus  makes  the  orator  the  sport  of  for- 
tune by  refusing  him  leave  to  retain  his  title  if  he 
fails  to  persuade.  Some  on  the  other  hand  pay  no  13 
attention  to  results,  as  for  example  Aristotle,1  who 
says  "  rhetoric  is  the  power  of  discovering  all  means  of 
persuading  by  speech."  This  definition  has  not  merely 
the  fault  already  mentioned,  but  the  additional  de- 
fect of  including  merely  the  power  of  invention, 
which  without  style  cannot  possibly  constitute 
oratory.  Hermagoras,  who  asserts  that  its  end  is  to  14 
speak  persuasively,  and  others  who  express  the  same 
opinion,  though  in  different  words,  and  inform  us 
that  the  end  is  to  say  everything  which  ought  to  be 
said  with  a  view  to  persuasion,  have  been  sufficiently 
answered  above,  when  I  proved  that  persuasion  was 
not  the  privilege  of  the  orator  alone.  Various  additions  1ft 
have  been  made  to  these  definitions.  For  some  hold 
that  rhetoric  is  concerned  with  everything,  while 
some  restrict  its  activity  to  politics.  The  question 
as  to  which  of  these  views  is  the  nearer  to  the  truth 
shall  be  discussed  later  in  its  appropriate  place.  Aris-  16 
totle  seems  to  have  implied  that  the  sphere  of  the 
orator  was  all-inclusive  when  he  defined  rhetoric  as 
the  power  to  detect  every  element  in  any  given  subject 
which  might  conduce  to  persuasion  ;  so  too  does  Patro- 
cles  who  omits  the  words  in  any  given  subject,  but 
since  he  excludes  nothing,  shows  that  his  view  is 
identical.  For  he  defines  rhetoric  as  the  power  to 
discover  whatever  is  persuasive  in  speech.  These  defini- 
tions like  that  quoted  above  include  no  more  than 
the  power  of  invention  alone.  Theodorus  avoids  this 
fault  and  holds  that  it  is  the  power  to  discover  and  to 
utter  forth  in  elegant  language  whatever  is  credible  in 
every  subject  of  oratory.  But,  while  others  besides  17

orators  may  discover  what  is  credible  as  well  as  per- 
suasive, by  adding  the  words  in  every  subject  he,  to  a 
greater  extent  than  the  others,  concedes  the  fairest 
name  in  all  the  world  to  those  who  use  their  gifts  as 
an  incitement  to  crime.  Plato  makes  Gorgias  ]  say  18 
that  he  is  a  master  of  persuasion  in  the  law-courts 
and  other  assemblies,  and  that  his  themes  are  justice 
and  injustice,  while  in  reply  Socrates  allows  him  the 
power  of  persuading,  but  not  of  teaching.  Those  19 
who  refused  to  make  the  sphere  of  oratory  all-inclu- 
sive, have  been  obliged  to  make  somewhat  forced 
and  long-winded  distinctions  :  among  these  I  may 
mention  Ariston,  the  pupil  of  the  Peripatetic  Crito- 
laus,  who  produced  the  following  definition,  ''Rhetoric 
is  the  science  of  seeing  and  uttering  what  ought  to  be 
said  on  political  questions  in  language  that  is  likely  to 
prove  persuasive  to  the  people."  Being  a  Peripatetic  he  20 
regards  it  as  a  science,  not,  like  the  Stoics,  as  a 
virtue,  while  in  adding  the  words  "  likely  to  prove 
persuasive  to  the  people"  he  inflicts  a  positive  insult  on 
oratory,  in  implying  that  it  is  not  likely  to  persuade  the 
learned.  The  same  criticism  will  apply  to  all  those  who 
restrict  oratory  to  political  questions,  for  they  ex- 
clude thereby  a  large  number  of  the  duties  of  an 
orator,  as  for  example  panegyric,  the  third  depart- 
ment of  oratory,  which  is  entirely  ignored.  Turning  21 
to  those  who  regard  rhetoric  as  an  art,  but  not  as  a 
virtue,  we  find  that  Theodorus  of  Gadara  is  more 
cautious.  For  he  says  (I  quote  the  words  of  his 
translators),  "  rhetoric  is  the  art  which  discovers  and 
judges  and  expresses,  with  an  elegance  duly  proportioned 
to  the  importance  of  all  such  elements  of  persuasion  as 
may  exist  in  any  subject  in  the  Jield  of  politics"  Simi-  22 
larly  Cornelius  Celsus  defines  the  end  of  rhetoric  as

lo  speak  persuasively  on  any  doubtful  subject  within  the 
Jield  of  politics.  Similar  definitions  are  given  by 
others,  such  for  instance  as  the  following  : —  "  rhetoric 
is  the  power  of  judging  and  holding  forth  on  such  poli- 
tical subjects  as  come  before  it  with  a  certain  persuasive- 
ness, a  certain  action  of  the  body  and  delivery  of  the 
words."  There  are  countless  other  definitions,  23 
either  identical  with  this  or  composed  of  the  same 
elements,  which  I  shall  deal  with  when  I  come  to 
the  questions  concerned  with  the  subject  matter  of 
rhetoric.  Some  regard  it  as  neither  a  power,  a 
science  or  an  art ;  Critolaus  calls  it  the  practice  of 
speaking  (for  this  is  the  meaning  of  rpi/3?/), 
Athenaeus  styles  it  the  art  of  deceiving,  while  the  24 
majority,  content  with  reading  a  few  passages  from 
the  Gorgias  of  Plato,  unskilfully  excerpted  by 
earlier  writers,  refrain  from  studying  that  dialogue 
and  the  remainder  of  Plato's  writings,  and  thereby 
fall  into  serious  error.  For  they  believe  that  in 
Plato's  view  rhetoric  was  not  an  art,  but  a  certain 
adroitness  in  the  production  of  delight  and  gratijlca- 
tion,1  or  with  reference  to  another  passage  the  25 
shadow  of  a  small  part  of  politics*  and  the  fourth  de- 
partment of  flattery.  For  Plato  assigns  3  two  depart- 
ments of  politics  to  the  body,  namely  medicine  and 
gymnastic,  and  two  to  the  soul,  namely  law  and 
justice,  while  he  styles  the  art  of  cookery  4  a  form  of 
flattery  of  medicine,  the  art  of  the  slave-dealer  a 
flattery  of  gymnastic,  for  they  produce  a  false  com- 
plexion by  the  use  of  paint  and  a  false  robustness 
by  puffing  them  out  with  fat  :  sophistry  he  calls  a 
dishonest  counterfeit  of  legal  science,  and  rhetoric  of 
justice.  All  these  statements  occur  in  the  Gorgiasand  26 
are  uttered  by  Socrates  who  appears  to  be  the  mouth-

piece  of  the  views  held  by  Plato.  But  some  of  his 
dialogues  were  composed  merely  to  refute  his 
opponents  and  are  styled  ref illative,  while  others  are 
for  the  purpose  of  teaching  and  are  called  doctrinal. 
Now  it  is  only  rhetoric  as  practised  in  their  own  day  27 
that  is  condemned  by  Plato  or  Socrates,  for  he 
speaks  of  it  as  "  the  manner  in  which  you  engage  in 
public  affairs  " 1  :  rhetoric  in  itself  he  regards  as  a 
genuine  and  honourable  thing,  and  consequently  the 
controversy  with  Gorgias  ends  with  the  words,  "  The 
rhetorician  therefore  must  be  just  and  the  just  man 
desirous  to  do  what  is  just." 2  To  this  Gorgias  28 
makes  no  reply,  but  the  argument  is  taken  up  by 
Polus,  a  hot-headed  and  headstrong  young  fellow, 
and  it  is  to  him  that  Socrates  makes  his  remarks 
about  "  shadows "  and  "forms  of  flattery."  Then 
Callicles,3  who  is  even  more  hot-headed,  intervenes, 
but  is  reduced  to  the  conclusion  that  "he  who  would 
truly  be  a  rhetorician  ought  to  be  just  and  possess  a 
knowledge  of  justice."  It  is  clear  therefore  that 
Plato  does  not  regard  rhetoric  as  an  evil,  but  holds 
that  true  rhetoric  is  impossible  for  any  save  a  just 
arid  good  man.  In  the  Phaedrus  4  he  makes  it  even  29 
clearer  that  the  complete  attainment  of  this  art  is 
impossible  without  the  knowledge  of  justice,  an 
opinion  in  which  I  heartily  concur.  Had  this  not 
been  his  view,  would  he  have  ever  written  the 
Apology  of  Socrates  or  the  Funeral  Oration 5  in 
praise  of  those  who  had  died  in  battle  for  their 
country,  both  of  them  works  falling  within  the 
sphere  of  oratory.  It  was  against  the  class  of  men  30 
who  employed  their  glibness  of  speech  for  evil  pur- 
poses that  he  directed  his  denunciations.  Similarly 
Socrates  thought  it  incompatible  with  his  honour  to

potest  etiam  Cornelius  Celsus,  cuius  liaec  verba  sunt : 
Orator  simile  tantum  veri  petit.       Deinde  paulo  post : 
Non    enim    bona    conscientia    sed    victoria    litigantis    est

make  use  of  the  speech  which  Lysias  composed  for 
his  defence,  although  it  was  the  usual  practice  in 
those  days  to  write  speeches  for  the  parties  con- 
cerned to  speak  in  the  courts  on  their  own  behalf, 
a  device  designed  to  circumvent  the  law  which  for- 
bade the  employment  of  advocates.  Further  the  31 
teachers  of  rhetoric  were  regarded  by  Plato  as  quite 
unsuited  to  their  professed  task.  For  they  divorced 
rhetoric  from  justice  and  preferred  plausibility  to 
truth,  as  he  states  in  the  Pkaedri/s.1  Cornelius  Celsus  32 
seems  to  have  agreed  with  these  early  rhetoricians, 
for  he  writes  "The  orator  only  aims  at  the  semblance 
of  truth,"  and  again  a  little  later  "  The  reward  of 
the  party  to  a  suit  is  not  a  good  conscience,  but  vic- 
tory." If  this  were  true,  only  the  worst  of  men 
would  place  such  dangerous  weapons  at  the  disposal 
of  criminals  or  employ  the  precepts  of  their  art  for 
the  assistance  of  wickedness.  However  I  will  leave 
those  who  maintain  these  views  to  consider  what 
ground  they  have  for  so  doing. 

For  my  part,  I  have  undertaken  the  task  of  mould-  33 
ing  the  ideal  orator,  and  as  my  first  desire  is  that  he 
should  be  a  good  man,  1  will  return  to  those  who 
have  sounder  opinions  on  the  subject.  Some  how- 
ever identify  rhetoric  with  politics,  Cicero  2  calls  it  a 
department  of  the  science  of  politics  (and  science  of 
politics  and  philosophy  are  identical  terms),  while 
others  again  call  it  a  branch  of  philosophy,  among 
them  Isocrates.  The  definition  which  best  suits  its  34 
real  character  is  that  which  makes  rhetoric  the  science 
of  speaking  well.  For  this  definition  includes  all  the 
virtues  of  oratory  and  the  character  of  the  orator  as 
well,  since  no  man  can  speak  well  who  is  not  good 
himself.  The  definition  given  by  Chrysippus,  who  35

coercent.      Albutius,    non   obscurus   professor  atque 
auctor,   scientiam   bene  dicendi   esse   consentit,   sed

derived  it  from  Cleanthes,  to  the  effect  that  it  is  the 
science  of  speaking  rightly,  amounts  to  the  same  thing. 
The  same  philosopher  also  gives  other  definitions, 
but  they  concern  problems  of  a  different  character 
from  that  on  which  we  are  now  engaged.  Another 
definition  defines  oratory  as  the  power  of  persuading 
men  to  do  what  ought  to  be  done,  and  yields  practically 
the  same  sense  save  that  it  limits  the  art  to  the  result 
which  it  produces.  Areus  again  defines  it  well  as  36 
speaking  according  to  the  excellence  of  speech.  Those  who 
regard  it  as  the  science  of  political  obligations,  also 
exclude  men  of  bad  character  from  the  title  of  orator, 
if  by  science  they  mean  virtue,  but  restrict  it  over- 
much by  confining  it  to  political  problems.  Albutius, 
a  distinguished  author  and  professor  of  rhetoric, 
agrees  that  rhetoric  is  the  science  of  speaking  well, 
but  makes  a  mistake  in  imposing  restrictions  by  the 
addition  of  the  words  on  political  questions  and  with 
credibility ;  with  both  of  these  restrictions  I  have 
already  dealt.  Finally  those  critics  who  hold  that  37 
the  aim  of  rhetoric  is  to  think  and  speak  rightly,  were 
on  the  correct  track. 

These  are  practically  all  the  most  celebrated  and 
most  discussed  definitions  of  rhetoric.  It  would  be 
both  irrelevant  and  beyond  my  power  to  deal  with  all. 
For  I  strongly  disapprove  of  the  custom  which  has 
come  to  prevail  among  writers  of  text-books  of  refusing 
to  define  anything  in  the  same  terms  as  have  been 
employed  by  some  previous  writer.  I  will  have 
nothing  to  do  with  such  ostentation.  What  I  say  38 
will  not  necessarily  be  my  own  invention,  but  it  will 
be  what  I  believe  to  be  the  right  view,  as  for  instance 
that  oratory  is  the  science  of  speaking  well.  For 
when  the  most  satisfactory  definition  has  been

found,  he  who  seeks  another,  is  merely  looking  for  a 
worse  one. 

Thus  much  being  admitted  we  are  now  in 
a  position  to  see  clearly  what  is  the  end,  the 
highest  aim,  the  ultimate  goal  of  rhetoric,  that  re'Aos 
in  fact  which  every  art  must  possess.  For  if  rhetoric 
is  the  science  of  speaking  well,  its  end  and  highest 
aim  is  to  speak  well. 

XVI.  There  follows  the  question  as  to  whether 
rhetoric  is  useful.  Some  are  in  the  habit  of 
denouncing  it  most  violently  and  of  shamelessly 
employing  the  powers  of  oratory  to  accuse  oratory 
itself.  "It  is  eloquence"  they  say  "that  snatches  2 
criminals  from  the  penalties  of  the  law,  eloquence 
that  from  time  to  time  secures  the  condemna- 
tion of  the  innocent  and  leads  deliberation  astray, 
eloquence  -that  stirs  up  not  merely  sedition  and 
popular  tumult,  but  wars  beyond  all  expiation,  and 
that  is  most  effective  when  it  makes  falsehood  prevail 
over  the  truth."  The  comic  poets  even  accuse  3 
Socrates  of  teaching  how  to  make  the  worse  cause 
seem  the  better,  while  Plato  says  that  Gorgias  and 
Tisias  made  similar  professions.  And  to  these  they  4 
add  further  examples  drawn  from  the  history  of 
Rome  and  Greece,  enumerating  all  those  who  used 
their  pernicious  eloquence  not  merely  against  indi- 
viduals but  against  whole  states  and  threw  an  ordered 
commonwealth  into  a  state  of  turmoil  or  even  brought 
it  to  utter  ruin  ;  and  they  point  out  that  for  this 
very  reason  rhetoric  was  banished  from  Sparta,  while 
its  powers  were  cut  down  at  Athens  itself  by  the  fact 
that  an  orator  was  forbidden  to  stir  the  passions  of 
his  audience.  On  the  showing  of  these  critics  not  only  5

and  Glaucia  were  magistrates.  Doctors  have  been 
caught  using  poisons,and  those  who  falsely  assume  the 
name  of  philosopher  have  occasionally  been  detected 
in  the  gravest  crimes.  Let  us  give  up  eating,  it  t 
often  makes  us  ill ;  let  us  never  go  inside  houses, 
for  sometimes  they  collapse  on  their  occupants ; 
let  never  a  sword  be  forged  for  a  soldier,  since 
it  might  be  used  by  a  robber.  And  who  does 
not  realise  that  fire  and  water,  both  necessities  of 
life,  and,  to  leave  mere  earthly  things,  even  the  sun 
and  moon,  the  greatest  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  are 
occasionally  capable  of  doing  harm. 

On  the  other  hand  will  it  be  denied  that  it  was   " 
by  his  gift  of  speech  that  Appius  the  Blind  broke 
off  the  dishonourable  peace  which  was  on  the  point 
of   beincr    concluded   with    Pvrrhus  ?     Did    not    the 

~  • 

divine  eloquence  of  Cicero  win  popular  applause 
even  when  he  denounced  the  Agrarian  laws,1  did  it 
not  crush  the  audacious  plots  of  Catiline  and  win, 
while  he  still  wore  the  garb  of  civil  life,  the  highest 
honour  that  can  be  conferred  on  a  victorious  general, 
a  public  thanksgiving  to  heaven  ?  Has  not  oratory  S 
often  revived  the  courage  of  a  panic-stricken  army 
and  persuaded  the  soldier  faced  by  all  the  perils  of 
war  that  glorv  is  a  fairer  thing  than  life  itself?  Xor 
shall  the  history  of  Sparta  and  Athens  move  me 
more  than  that  of  the  Roman  people,  who  have 
always  held  the  orator  in  highest  honour.  Never  in  9

duced their  unsettled  multitudes  to  form  communi- 
ties had  they  not  moved  them  by  the  magic  of  their 
eloquence  :  never  without  the  highest  gifts  of  oratory

would  the  great  legislators  have  constrained  man- 
kind to  submit  themselves  to  the  yoke  of  law.  Nay,  10 
even  the  principles  which  should  guide  our  life, 
however  fair  they  may  be  by  nature,  yet  have  greater 
power  to  mould  the  mind  to  virtue,  when  the  beauty 
of  things  is  illumined  by  the  splendour  of  eloquence. 
Wherefore,  although  the  weapons  of  oratory  may 
be  used  either  for  good  or  ill,  it  is  unfair  to  regard 
that  as  an  evil  which  can  be  employed  for  good. 

These   problems,  however,  may  be  left  to  those  11 
who  hold  that  rhetoric  is  the  power  to  persuade.     If 
our  definition  of  rhetoric  as  the  science  of  speaking 
well  implies    that  an   orator  must  be  a  good  man, 
there  can  be  no  doubt  about  its  usefulness.      And  12 
in  truth   that  god,  who  was  in  the    beginning,  the 
father  of  all  things  and  the  architect  of  the  universe, 
distinguished    man  from    all    other   living  creatures 
that    are    subject  to   death,  by  nothing  more  than 
this,  that  he  gave  him  the  gift  of  speech.      For  as  13 
regards  physical   bulk,  strength,  robustness,  endur- 
ance or  speed,  man  is  surpassed  in  certain  cases  by 
dumb  beasts,  who  also  are  far  more  independent  of 
external  assistance.     They  know  by  instinct  without 
need  of  any  teacher  how  to  move  rapidly,  to  feed 
themselves  and  swim.      Many  too  have  their  bodies   14 
clothed   against   cold,  possess   natural  weapons  and 
have    not    to  search    for  their   food,  whereas  in   all 
these   respects   man's   life    is    full  of  toil.      Reason 
then  was  the   greatest  gift  of  the  Almighty,  who 
willed  that  we  should  share  its  possession  with  the 
immortal  gods.      But  reason  by  itself  would  help  us  15 
but  little  and  would  be  far  less  evident  in  us,  had 
we  not  the  power  to  express  our  thoughts  in  speech ; 
for  it  is  the  lack  of  this  power  rather  than  thought

and  understanding  which  they  do  to  a  certain  ex- 
tent possess,  that  is  the  great  defect  in  other  living 
things.  The  construction  of  a  soft  lair,  the  weaving  16 
of  nests,  the  hatching  and  rearing  of  their  young,  and 
even  the  storing  up  of  food  for  the  coming  winter, 
together  with  certain  other  achievements  which  we 
cannot  imitate,  such  as  the  making  of  honey  and 
wax,  all  these  perhaps  indicate  the  possession  of  a 
certain  degree  of  reason  ;  but  since  the  creatures  that 
do  these  things  lack  the  gift  of  speech  they  are  called 
dumb  and  unreasoning  beasts.  Finally,  how  little  17 
the  heavenly  boon  of  reason  avails  those  who  are 
born  dumb.  If  therefore  we  have  received  no  fairer 
gift  from  heaven  than  speech,  what  shall  wre  regard 
as  so  worthy  of  laborious  cultivation,  or  in  what 
should  we  sooner  desire  to  excel  our  fellowr-men, 
than  that  in  which  mankind  excels  all  other  living 
things?  And  we  should  be  all  the  more  eager  to  do  18 
so,  since  there  is  no  art  which  yields  a  more  grateful 
recompense  for  the  labour  bestowed  upon  it.  This 
will  be  abundantly  clear  if  we  consider  the  origins 
of  oratory  and  the  progress  it  has  made  ;  and  it  is 
capable  of  advancing  still  further.  I  will  not  stop  19 
to  point  out  how  useful  and  how  becoming  a  task  it  is 
for  a  good  man  to  defend  his  friends,  to  guide  the 
senate  by  his  counsels,  and  to  lead  peoples  or  armies 
to  follow  his  bidding ;  I  merely  ask,  is  it  not  a 
noble  thing,  by  employing  the  understanding  which 
is  common  to  mankind  and  the  words  that  are  used 
by  all,  to  win  such  honour  and  glory  that  you  seem 
not  to  speak  or  plead,  but  rather,  as  was  said  of 
Pericles,  to  thunder  and  lighten  ? l

on  for  ever.  Let  us  therefore  pass  to  the  next 
question  and  consider  whether  rhetoric  is  an  art. 
No  one  of  those  who  have  laid  down  rules  for  2 
oratory  has  ever  doubted  that  it  is  an  art.  It  is  clear 
even  from  the  titles  of  their  books  that  their  theme 
is  the  art  of  rhetoric,  while  Cicero1  defines  rhetoric 
as  artistic  eloquence.  And  it  is  not  merely  the  orators 
who  have  claimed  this  distinction  for  their  studies 
with  a  view  to  giving  them  an  additional  title  to 
respect,  but  the  Stoic  and  Peripatetic  philosophers  for 
the  most  part  agree  with  them.  Indeed  I  will  confess  3 
that  I  had  doubts  as  to  whether  I  should  discuss  this 
portion  of  my  inquiry,  for  there  is  no  one,  I  will  not 
say  so  unlearned,  but  so  devoid  of  ordinary  sense,  as 
to  hold  that  building,  weaving;  or  moulding  vessels 

O-7  O  O 

from  clay  are  arts,  and  at  the  same  time  to  consider 
that  rhetoric,  which,  as  I  have  already  said,  is  the 
noblest  and  most  sublime  of  tasks,  has  reached  such 
a  lofty  eminence  without  the  assistance  of  art.  For  4 
my  own  part  I  think  that  those  who  have  argued 
against  this  view  did  not  realise  what  they  were 
saying,  but  merely  desired  to  exercise  their  wits  by 
the  selection  of  a  difficult  theme,  like  Poly  crates, 
when  he  praised  Busiris  and  Clytemnestra  ;  I  may 
add  that  he  is  credited  with  a  not  dissimilar  per- 
formance, namely  the  composition  of  a  speech  which 
was  delivered  against  Socrates. 

Some  wrould  have  it  that  rhetoric  is  a  natural  gift  5 
though  they  admit  that  it  can  be  developed  by  practice. 
So  Antonius  in  the  de  Oraiore2  of  Cicero  styles  it  a  knack 
derived  from  experience,  but  denies  that  it  is  an  art : 
this  statement  is  however  not  intended  to  be  accepted  6 
by  us  as  the  actual  truth,  but  is  inserted  to  make

Antonius  speak  in  character,  since  he  was  in  the 
habit  of  concealing  his  art.  Still  Lysias  is  said  to 
have  maintained  this  same  view,  which  is  defended 
on  the  ground  that  uneducated  persons,  barbarians 
and  slaves,  when  speaking  on  their  own  behalf,  say 
something  that  resembles  an  exordium,  state  the  facts 
of  the  case,  prove,  refute  and  plead  for  mercy  just  as 
an  orator  does  in  his  peroration.  To  this  is  added  7 
the  quibble  that  nothing  that  is  based  on  art  can 
have  existed  before  the  art  in  question,  whereas  men 
have  always  from  time  immemorial  spoken  in  their 
own  defence  or  in  denunciation  of  others :  the 
teaching  of  rhetoric  as  an  art  was,  they  say,  a  later 
invention  dating  from  about  the  time  of  Tisias  and 
Corax :  oratory  therefore  existed  before  art  and 
consequently  cannot  be  an  art.  For  my  part  I  am  not  8 
concerned  with  the  date  when  oratory  began  to  be 
taught.  Even  in  Homer  we  find  Phoenix l  as  an 
instructor  not  only  of  conduct  but  of  speaking,  while 
a  number  of  orators  are  mentioned,  the  various  styles 
are  represented  by  the  speeches  of  three  of  the 
chiefs  2  and  the  young  men  are  set  to  contend  among 
themselves  in  contests  of  eloquence  :3  moreover  law- 
suits and  pleaders  are  represented  in  the  engravings 
on  the  shield  of  Achilles.4  It  is  sufficient  to  call  9 
attention  to  the  fact  that  everything  which  art  has 
brought  to  perfection  originated  in  nature.  Other- 
wise we  might  deny  the  title  of  art  to  medicine, 
which  was  discovered  from  the  observation  of 
sickness  and  health,  and  according  to  some  is 
entirely  based  upon  experiment :  wounds  were  bound 
up  long  before  medicine  developed  into  an  art,  and 
fevers  were  reduced  by  rest  and  abstention  from  food, 
long  before  the  reason  for  such  treatment  was

known,  simply  because  the  state  of  the  patient's 
health  left  no  choice.  So  too  building  should  not  be  10 
styled  an  art ;  for  primitive  man  built  himself  a  hut 
without  the  assistance  of  art.  Music  by  the  same 
reasoning  is  not  an  art ;  for  every  race  indulges  in 
some  kind  of  singing  and  dancing.  If  therefore  any 
kind  of  speech  is  to  be  called  eloquence,  I  will  admit 
that  it  existed  before  it  was  an  art.  If  on  the  other  1 1 
hand  not  every  man  that  speaks  is  an  orator  and 
primitive  man  did  not  speak  like  an  orator,  my 
opponents  must  needs  acknowledge  that  oratory  is 
the  product  of  art  and  did  not  exist  before  it.  This 
conclusion  also  rules  out  their  argument  that  men 
speak  who  have  never  learnt  how  to  speak,  and  that 
which  a  man  does  untaught  can  have  no  connexion 
with  art.  In  support  of  this  contention  they  adduce  12 
the  fact  that  Demades  was  a  waterman  and  Aeschines 
an  actor,  but  both  were  orators.  Their  reasoning  is 
false.  For  no  man  can  be  an  orator  untaught  and  it 
would  be  truer  to  say  that  these  orators  learned 
oratory  late  in  life  than  that  they  never  learned  at  all ; 
although  as  a  matter  of  fact  Aeschines  had  an 
acquaintance  with  literature  from  childhood  since  his 
father  was  a  teacher  of  literature,  while  as  regards 
Demades,  it  is  quite  uncertain  that  he  never  studied 
rhetoric  and  in  any  case  continuous  practice  in 
speaking  was  sufficient  to  bring  him  to  such  profici- 
ency as  he  attained  :  for  experience  is  the  best  of  all 
schools.  On  the  other  hand  it  may  fairly  be  asserted  13 
that  he  would  have  achieved  greater  distinction,  if  he 
had  received  instruction  :  for  although  he  delivered 
his  speeches  with  great  effect,  he  never  ventured  to 
write  them  for  others.  Aristotle,  it  is  true,  in  his  14

the  contrary,  which  are  marked  by  characteristic 
ingenuity.  On  the  other  hand  he  also  wrote  three 
books  on  the  art  of  rhetoric,  in  the  first  of  which 
he  not  merely  admits  that  rhetoric  is  an  art,  but 
treats  it  as  a  department  of  politics  and  also  of 
logic.  Critolaus  and  Athenodorus  of  Rhodes  have  15 

O 

produced  many  arguments  against  this  view,  while 
Agnon  renders  himself  suspect  by  the  very  title  of 
his  book  in  which  he  proclaims  that  he  is  going  to 
indict  rhetoric.  As  to  the  statements  of  Epicurus 
on  this  subject,  they  cause  me  no  surprise,  for  he  is 
the  foe  of  all  systematic  training. 

These  gentlemen  talk  a  great  deal,  but  the  16 
arguments  on  which  they  base  their  statements  are 
few.  I  will  therefore  select  the  most  important  of 
them  and  will  deal  with  them  briefly,  to  prevent  the 
discussion  lasting  to  all  eternity.  Their  first  con-  17 
tention  is  based  on  the  subject-matter;  for  they 
assert  that  all  arts  have  their  own  subject-matter 
(which  is  true)  and  go  on  to  say  that  rhetoric  has 
none,  which  I  shall  show  in  what  follows  to  be  false. 
Another  slander  is  to  the  effect  that  no  art  will  IS 
acquiesce  in  false  opinions :  since  an  art  must  be 
based  on  direct  perception,  which  is  always  true: 
now,  say  they,  rhetoric  does  give  its  assent  to  false 
conclusions  and  is  therefore  not  an  art.  I  will  admit  19 
that  rhetoric  sometimes  substitutes  falsehood  for 
truth,  but  I  will  not  allow  that  it  does  so  because  its 
opinions  are  false,  since  there  is  all  the  difference 
between  holding  a  certain  opinion  oneself  and 
persuading  someone  else  to  adopt  an  opinion.  For 
instance  a  general  frequently  makes  use  of  false- 
hood :  Hannibal  when  hemmed  in  by  Fabius 
persuaded  his  enemy  that  he  was  in  retreat  by

tying  brushwood  to  the  horns  of  oxen,  setting  fire 
to  them  by  night  and  driving  the  herds  across 
the  mountains  opposite.1  But  though  he  deceived 
Fabius,  he  himself  was  fully  aware  of  the  truth.

Again  when  the  Spartan  Theopompus  changed  '20 
clothes  with  his  wife  and  escaped  from  custody 
disguised  as  a  woman,  he  deceived  his  guards, 
but  was  not  for  a  moment  deceived  as  to  his  owrn 
identity.2  Similarly  an  orator,  when  he  substitutes 
falsehood  for  the  truth,  is  aware  of  the  falsehood 
and  of  the  fact  that  he  is  substituting  it  for  the 

o 

truth.  He  therefore  deceives  others,  but  not  him- 
self. When  Cicero  boasted  that  he  had  thrown  21 
dust  in  the  eyes  of  the  jury  in  the  case  of 
Cluentius,  he  was  far  from  being  blinded  himself. 
And  when  a  painter  by  his  artistic  skill  makes  us 
believe  that  certain  objects  project  from  the  picture, 
while  others  are  withdrawn  into  the  background,  he 
knows  perfectly  well  that  they  are  really  all  in  the 
same  plane.  My  opponents  further  assert  that  every  22 
art  has  some  definite  goal  towards  which  it  directs  its 
efforts,  but  that  rhetoric  as  a  rule  has  no  such  goal, 
while  at  other  times  it  professes  to  have  an  aim,  but 
fails  to  perform  its  promise.  They  lie :  I  have  already 
shown  that  rhetoric  has  a  definite  purpose  and  have 
explained  what  it  is.  And,  what  is  more,  the  orator  23 
will  always  make  good  his  professions  in  this  respect, 
for  he  will  always  speak  well.  On  the  other  hand 
this  criticism  may  perhaps  hold  good  as  against  those 
who  think  persuasion  the  end  of  oratory.  But  our 
orator  and  his  art,  as  we  define  it,  are  independent  of 
results.  The  speaker  aims  at  victory,  it  is  true,  but  if 
he  speaks  well,  he  has  lived  up  to  the  ideals  of  his  art, 
even  if  he  is  defeated.  Similarly  a  pilot  will  desire  24

to  bring  his  ship  safe  to  harbour;  but  if  he  is  swept 
out  of  his  course  by  a  storm,  he  will  not  for  that 
reason  cease  to  be  a  pilot,  but  will  say  in  the  well- 
known  words  of  the  old  poet l  "  Still  let  me  steer 
straight  on  !  "  So  too  the  doctor  seeks  to  heal  the  25 
sick  ;  but  if  the  violence  of  the  disease  or  the  refusal 
of  the  patient  to  obey  his  regimen  or  any  other 
circumstance  prevent  his  achieving  his  purpose,  he 
will  not  have  fallen  short  of  the  ideals  of  his  art, 
provided  he  has  done  everything  according  to  reason. 
So  too  the  orator's  purpose  is  fulfilled  if  he  has  spoken 
well.  For  the  art  of  rhetoric,  as  I  shall  show  later, 
is  realised  in  action,  not  in  the  result  obtained.  From  26 
this  it  follows  that  there  is  no  truth  in  yet  another 
argument  which  contends  that  arts  know  when  they 
have  attained  their  end,  whereas  rhetoric  does  not. 
For  every  speaker  is  aware  when  he  is  speaking  well. 
These  critics  also  charge  rhetoric  with  doing  what 
no  art  does,  namely  making  use  of  vices  to  serve  its 
ends,  since  it  speaks  the  thing  that  is  not  and  excites 
the  passions.  But  there  is  no  disgrace  in  doing  27 
either  of  these  things,  as  long  as  the  motive  be  good  : 
consequently  there  is  nothing  vicious  in  such  action. 
Even  a  philosopher  is  at  times  permitted  to  tell  a  lie, 
while  the  orator  must  needs  excite  the  passions,  if 
that  be  the  only  way  by  which  he  can  lead  the 
judge  to  do  justice.  For  judges  are  not  always  2S 
enlightened  and  often  have  to  be  tricked  to  prevent 
them  falling  into  error.  Give  me  philosophers  as 
judges,  pack  senates  and  assemblies  with  philosophers, 
and  you  will  destroy  the  power  of  hatred,  influence, 
prejudice  and  false  witness  ;  consequently  there  will 
be  very  little  scope  for  eloquence  whose  value  will 
lie  almost  entirely  in  its  power  to  charm.  But  if,  as  is  29

the  case,  our  hearers  are  fickle  of  mind,  and  truth  is 
exposed  to  a  host  of  perils,  we  must  call  in  art  to  aid 
us  in  the  fight  and  employ  such  means  as  will  help 
our  case.  He  who  has  been  driven  from  the  right  road 
cannot  be  brought  back  to  it  save  by  a  fresh  detour. 

The  point,  however,  that  gives  rise  to  the  greatest  30 
number  of  these  captious  accusations  against  rhetoric, 
is    found   in   the   allegation   that    orators    speak    in- 
differently on  either  side  of  a  case.   From  which  they 
draw  the  following  arguments  :    no  art  is  self-contra- 
dictory,  but  rhetoric  does   contradict  itself;   no  art 
tries  to  demolish  what  itself  has  built,   but  this  does 
happen  in  the  operations  of  rhetoric  ;  or  again  :- 
rhetoric  teaches  either  what  ought  to  be  said  or  what 
ought  not  to  be  said  ;  consequently  it  is  not  an  art 
because   it  teaches   what   ought  not  to  be  said,   or 
because,  while  it  teaches  what  ought  to  be  said,  it 
also  teaches  precisely  the  opposite.   Now  it  is  obvious  3 1 
that  all  such  charges  are  brought  against  that  type 
of  rhetoric  with  which  neither  good  men  nor  virtue 
herself  will  have  anything  to  do ;  since  if  a  case  be 
based  on  injustice,  rhetoric  has  no  place  therein  and 
consequently  it  can  scarcely  happen  even  under  the 
most  exceptional  circumstances  that  an  orator,   that 
is  to  say,  a  good  man,  will  speak  indifferently  on  either 
side.      Still  it  is  in  the  nature  of  things  conceivable  32 
that  just  causes   may   lead  two   wise   men    to   take 
different  sides,  since  it  is  held  that  wise  men  may  fight 
among  themselves,  provided  that  they  do  so  at  the 
bidding   of  reason.       I  will  therefore  reply  to  their 
criticisms  in  such  a  way  that  it  will  be  clear  that  these 
arguments  have  no  force  even  against  those  who  con- 
cede the  name  of  orator  to  persons  of  bad  character. 
For  rhetoric  is  not  self-contradictory.    The  conflict  is  33

between  case  and  case,  not  between   rhetoric    and 
itself.      And  even  if  persons  who  have  learned  the 
same  thing  fight  one  another,  that  does  not  prove 
that  what  they  have  learned  is  not  an  art.      Were 
that  so,  there  could  be  no  art  of  arms,  since  gladiators 
trained  under  the  same  master  are  often  matched 
against  each  other ;  nor  would  the  pilot's  art  exist,  34 
because  in  sea-fights  pilots  may  be  found  011  different 
sides;  nor  yet  could  there  be  an  art  of  generalship, 
since  general  is  pitted  against  general.     In  the  same 
way  rhetoric  does  not  undo  its  own  work.      For  the 
orator  does  not  refute  his  own  arguments,  nor  does 
rhetoric  even  do  so,  because  those  who  regard  persua- 
sion as  its  end,  or  the  two  good  men  whom  chance  has 
matched  against  one  another  seek  merely  for   proba- 
bilities :  and  the  fact  that  one  thing  is  more  credible 
than  another,  does  not  involve  contradiction  between 
the  two.     There  is  no  absolute  antagonism  between  35 
the  probable  and  the  more  probable,  just  as  there  is 
none  between  that  which  is  white  and  that  which  is 
whiter,    or  between  that  which   is   sweet  and   that 
which  is  sweeter.     Nor  does  rhetoric  ever  teach  that 
which  ought  not  to  be  said,  or  that  which  is  contrary 
to  what  ought  to  be  said,  but  solely  what  ought  to  be 
said  in  each  individual  case.      But  though  the  orator  36 
will   as   a   rule   maintain   what   is  true,  this  will  not 
always  be  the  case  :    there  are  occasions  when  the 
public  interest  demands  that  he  should  defend  what 
is  untrue. 

The  following  objections  are  also  put  forward  in 
the  second  book  of  Cicero's  de  Oratore  l  : — "  Art  deals 
with  things  that  are  known.  But  the  pleading  of  an 
orator  is  based  entirely  on  opinion,  not  on  knowledge, 
because  he  speaks  to  an  audience  who  do  not  know,

vera   sit,   nescit.      Ne   medicus  quidem,  an   dolorern

tanquam   id   verum  sit,  et  erit  ars  medicina.      Quid

40  verisimilia  quae  dicit.      Adiiciunt  his,  qui  contra  sen-

and  sometimes  himself  states  things  of  which  he  has 
no  actual  knowledge."  Now  one  of  these  points,  3" 
namely  whether  the  judges  have  knowledge  of  what 
is  being  said  to  them,  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  art 
of  oratory.  The  other  statement,  that  art  is  concerned 
with  things  that  are  known,  does  however  require  an 
answer.  Rhetoric  is  the  art  of  speaking  well  and  the 
orator  knows  how  to  speak  well.  "  But,"  it  is  urged,  38 
"  he  does  not  know  whether  what  he  says  is  true.'' 
Neither  do  they,  who  assert  that  all  things  derive 
their  origin  from  fire  or  water  or  the  four  elements 
or  indivisible  atoms ;  nor  they  who  calculate  the 
distances  of  the  stars  or  the  size  of  the  earth  and  sun. 
And  yet  all  these  call  the  subject  which  they  teach 
an  art.  But  if  reason  makes  them  seem  not  merely 
to  hold  opinions  but,  thanks  to  the  cogency  of  the 
proofs  adduced,  to  have  actual  knowledge,  reason  will 
do  the  same  service  to  the  orator.  "  But,"  they  say,  39 
"he  does  not  know  whether  the  cause  which  he  has 
undertaken  is  true."  But  not  even  a  doctor  can  tell 
whether  a  patient  who  claims  to  be  suffering  from  a 
headache,  really  is  so  suffering  :  but  he  will  treat  him 
on  the  assumption  that  his  statement  is  true,  and 
medicine  will  still  be  an  art.  Again  what  of  the  fact 
that  rhetoric  does  not  always  aim  at  telling  the  truth, 
but  always  at  stating  what  is  probable  ?  The  answer 
is  that  the  orator  knows  that  what  he  states  is  no 
more  than  probable.  My  opponents  further  object  40 
that  advocates  often  defend  in  one  case  what  they 
have  attacked  in  another.  This  is  not  the  fault  of  the 
art,  but  of  the  man.  Such  are  the  main  points  that 
are  urged  against  rhetoric  ;  there  are  others  as  well, 
but  they  are  of  minor  importance  and  drawn  from  the 
same  sources.

That  rhetoric  is  an  art  may,  however,  be  proved  in  41 
a  very  few  words.  For  if  Cleanthes' l  definition  be 
accepted  that  "Art  is  a  power  reaching  its  ends  by  a 
definite  path,  that  is,  by  ordered  methods,"  no  one 
can  doubt  that  there  is  such  method  and  order  in 
good  speaking  :  while  if,  on  the  other  hand,  we  accept 
the  definition  which  meets  with  almost  universal 
approval  that  art  consists  in  perceptions  agreeing 
and  cooperating  to  the  achievement  of  some  useful 
end,  we  shall  be  able  to  show  that  rhetoric  lacks  none 
of  these  characteristics.  Again  it  is  scarcely  necessary  42 
for  me  to  point  out  that  like  other  arts  it  is  based  on 
examination  and  practice.  And  if  logic  is  an  art,  as 
is  generally  agreed,  rhetoric  must  also  be  an  art,  since 
it  differs  from  logic  in  species  rather  than  in  genus. 
Nor  must  I  omit  to  point  out  that  where  it  is  possible 
in  any  given  subject  for  one  man  to  act  without  art 
and  another  with  art,  there  must  necessarily  be  an 
art  in  connexion  with  that  subject,  as  there  must  also 
be  in  any  subject  in  which  the  man  who  has  received 
instruction  is  the  superior  of  him  who  has  not.  But  43 
as  regards  the  practice  of  rhetoric,  it  is  not  merely 
the  case  that  the  trained  speaker  will  get  the  better 
of  the  untrained.  For  even  the  trained  man  will 
prove  inferior  to  one  who  has  received  a  better 
training.  If  this  were  not  so,  there  would  not  be  so 
many  rhetorical  rules,  nor  would  so  many  great  men 
have  come  forward  to  teach  them.  The  truth  of  this 
must  be  acknowledged  by  everyone,  but  more 
especially  by  us,  since  we  concede  the  possession  of 
oratory  to  none  save  the  good  man.2 

XVIII.  Some  arts,  however,  are  based  on  examina- 
tion, that  is  to  say  on  the  knowledge  and  proper 
appreciation  of  things,  as  for  instance  astronomy,

which  demands  no  action,  but  is  content  to  understand 
the  subject  of  its  study  :  sucli  arts  are  called  theoretical. 
Others  again  are  concerned  with  action  :  this  is  their 
end,  which  is  realised  in  action,  so  that,  the  action 
once  performed,  nothing  more  remains  to  do  :  these 
arts  we  style  practical,  and  dancing  will  provide  us 
with  an  example.  Thirdly  there  are  others  which  2 
consist  in  producing  a  certain  result  and  achieve  their 
purpose  iri  the  completion  of  a  visible  task  :  such  we 
style  productive,  and  painting  may  be  quoted  as  an 
illustration.  In  view  of  these  facts  we  must  come  to 
the  conclusion  that,  in  the  main,  rhetoric  is  concerned 
with  action ;  for  in  action  it  accomplishes  that  which 
it  is  its  duty  to  do.  This  view  is  universally  accepted,  3 
although  in  my  opinion  rhetoric  draws  largely  on  the 
two  other  kinds  of  art.  For  it  may  on  occasion  be 
content  with  the  mere  examination  of  a  thing. 
Rhetoric  is  still  in  the  orator's  possession  even  though 
he  be  silent,  while  if  he  gives  up  pleading  either 
designedly  or  owing  to  circumstances  over  which  he 
has  no  control,  he  does  not  therefore  cease  to  be  an 
orator,  any  more  than  a  doctor  ceases  to  be  a  doctor 
when  he  withdraws  from  practice.  Perhaps  the  4 
highest  of  all  pleasures  is  that  which  we  derive  from 
private  study,  and  the  only  circumstances  under 
which  the  delights  of  literature  are  unalloyed  are 
when  it  withdraws  from  action,  that  is  to  say  from 
toil,  and  can  enjoy  the  pleasure  of  self-contemplation. 
But  in  the  results  that  the  orator  obtains  by  writing  5 
speeches  or  historical  narratives,  which  we  may  reason- 
ably count  as  part  of  the  task  of  oratory,  we  shall 
recognise  features  resembling  those  of  a  productive 
art.  Still,  if  rhetoric  is  to  be  regarded  as  one  of  these 
three  classes  of  art,  since  it  is  with  action  that  its

practice  is  chiefly  and  most  frequently  concerned,  let 
us  call  it  an  active  or  administrative  art,  the  two 
terms  being  identical. 

XIX.  I  quite  realise  that  there  is  a  further  ques- 
tion as  to  whether  eloquence  derives  most  from 
nature  or  from  education.  This  question  really  lies 
outside  the  scope  of  our  inquiry,  since  the  ideal 
orator  must  necessarily  be  the  result  of  a  blend  of 
both.  But  1  do  regard  it  as  of  great  importance 
that  we  should  decide  how  far  there  is  any  real 
question  on  this  point.  For  if  we  make  an  absolute  2 
divorce  between  the  two,  nature  will  still  be  able  to 
accomplish  much  without  the  aid  of  education, 
while  the  latter  is  valueless  without  the  aid  of 
nature.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  they  are  blended  in 
equal  proportions,  I  think  we  shall  find  that  the 
average  .orator  owes  most  to  nature,  while  the  per- 
fect orator  owes  more  to  education.  We  may  take 
a  parallel  from  agriculture.  A  thoroughly  barren 
soil  will  not  be  improved  even  by  the  best  cultivation, 
while  good  land  will  yield  some  useful  produce 
without  any  cultivation  ;  but  in  the  case  of  really 
rich  land  cultivation  will  do  more  for  it  than  its  own 
natural  fertility.  Had  Praxiteles  attempted  to  carve  3 
a  statue  out  of  a  millstone,  I  should  have  preferred 
a  rough  block  of  Parian  marble  to  any  such  statue. 
On  the  other  hand,  if  the  same  artist  had  produced 
a  finished  statue  from  such  a  block  of  Parian  marble, 
its  artistic  value  would  owe  more  to  his  skill  than 
to  the  material.  To  conclude,  nature  is  the  raw 
material  for  education  :  the  one  forms,  the  other  is 
formed.  Without  material  art  can  do  nothing, 
material  without  art  does  possess  a  certain  value, 
while  the  perfection  of  art  is  better  than  the  best 

material.

toric is  to  be  regarded  as  one  of  the  indifferent  arts, 
which  in  themselves  deserve  neither  praise  nor  blame, 
but  are  useful  or  the  reverse  according  to  the  charac- 
ter of  the  artist ;  or  whether  it  should,  as  not  a  few 
even  among  philosophers  hold,  be  considered  as  a 
virtue.  For  my  own  part  I  regard  the  practice  of  rhe-  2 
toric  which  so  many  have  adopted  in  the  past  and  still 
follow  to-day,  as  either  no  art  at  all,  or,  as  the  Greeks 
call  it,  ar^via  (for  I  see  numbers  of  speakers  with- 
out the  least  pretension  to  method  or  literary  train- 
ing rushing  headlong  in  the  direction  in  which 
hunger  or  their  natural  shamelessness  calls  them) ; 
or  else  it  is  a  bad  art  such  as  is  styled  KaKore^rta. 
For  there  have,  I  think,  been  many  persons  and 
there  are  still  some  who  have  devoted  their  powers 
of  speaking  to  the  destruction  of  their  fellow-men. 
There  is  also  an  unprofitable  imitation  of  art,  a  kind  3 
of  /iaTcuoT€xl '«**  which  is  neither  good  nor  bad,  but 
merely  involves  a  useless  expenditure  of  labour,  re- 
minding one  of  the  man  who  shot  a  continuous 
stream  of  vetch-seeds  from  a  distance  through  the 
eye  of  a  needle,  without  ever  missing  his  aim,  and 
was  rewarded  by  Alexander,  who  was  a  witness  of 
the  display,  with  the  present  of  a  bushel  of  vetch- 
seeds,  a  most  appropriate  reward.  It  is  to  such  men  4 
that  I  would  compare  those  who  spend  their  whole 
time  at  the  expense  of  much  study  and  energy  in 
composing  declamations,  which  they  aim  at  making 
as  unreal  as  possible.  The  rhetoric  on  the  other 
hand,  which  I  am  endeavouring  to  establish  and  the 
ideal  of  which  I  have  in  my  mind's  eye,  that  rhetoric 
which  befits  a  good  man  and  is  in  a  word  the  only 
true  rhetoric,  will  be  a  virtue.  Philosophers  arrive  5

at  this  conclusion  by  a  long  chain  of  ingenious 
arguments  ;  but  it  appears  to  me  to  be  perfectly 
clear  from  the  simpler  proof  of  my  own  invention 
which  I  will  now  proceed  to  set  forth. 

The  philosophers  state  the  case  as  follows.  If 
self-consistency  as  to  what  should  and  should  not 
be  done  is  an  element  of  virtue  (and  it  is  to  this 
quality  that  we  give  the  name  of  prudence),  the 
same  quality  will  be  revealed  as  regards  what  should 
be  said  and  what  should  not  be  said,  and  if  there  are  6 
virtues,  of  which  nature  has  given  us  some  rudimen- 
tary sparks,  even  before  we  were  taught  anything 
about  them,  as  for  instance  justice,  of  which  there  are 
some  traces  even  among  peasants  and  barbarians,  it 
is  clear  that  man  has  been  so  formed  from  the 
beginning  as  to  be  able  to  plead  on  his  own  behalf, 
not,  it  is  true,  with  perfection,  but  yet  sufficiently  to 
show  that  there  are  certain  sparks  of  eloquence 
implanted  in  us  by  nature.  The  same  nature,  how-  7 
ever,  is  not  to  be  found  in  those  arts  which  have  no 
connexion  with  virtue.  Consequently,  since  there  are 
two  kinds  of  speech,  the  continuous  which  is  called 
rhetoric,  and  the  concise  which  is  called  dialectic  (the 
relation  between  which  was  regarded  by  Zeno  as  being 
so  intimate  that  he  compared  the  latter  to  the  closed 
fist,  the  former  to  the  open  hand),  even  the  art  of 
disputation  will  be  a  virtue.  Consequently  there  can 
be  no  doubt  about  oratory  whose  nature  is  so  much 
fairer  and  franker. 

I    should  like,    however,    to    consider    the    point  8 
more     fully    and     explicitly    by    appealing    to    the 
actual  work   of    oratory.     For  how   will   the   orator 
succeed  in  panegyric  unless  he  can  distinguish  be- 
tween what  is  honourable  and   the  reverse  ?     How

can  he  urge  a  policy,  unless  he  has  a  clear  percep- 
tion of  what  is  expedient  ?  How  can  he  plead  in 
the  law-courts,  if  he  is  ignorant  of  the  nature  of 
justice  ?  Again,  does  not  oratory  call  for  courage, 
since  it  is  often  directed  against  the  threats  of 
popular  turbulence  and  frequently  runs  into  peril 
through  incurring  the  hatred  of  the  great,  while 
sometimes,  as  for  instance  in  the  trial  of  Milo,  the 
orator  may  have  to  speak  in  the  midst  of  a  crowd  of 
armed  soldiers?  Consequently,  if  oratory  be  not  a 
virtue,  perfection  is  beyond  its  grasp.  If,  on  the  9 
other  hand,  each  living  thing  has  its  own  peculiar 
virtue,  in  which  it  excels  the  rest  or,  at  any  rate,  the 
majority  (I  may  instance  the  courage  of  the  lion 
and  the  swiftness  of  the  horse),  it  may  be  regarded 
as  certain  that  the  qualities  in  which  man  excels 
the  rest  are,  above  all,  reason  and  powers  of  speech. 
Why,  therefore,  should  wre  not  consider  that  the 
special  virtue  of  man  lies  just  as  much  in  elo- 
quence as  in  reason?  It  will  be  with  justice  then 
that  Cicero  1  makes  Crassus  say  that  ' '  eloquence  is 
one  of  the  highest  virtues,"  and  that  Cicero  himself 
calls  it  a  virtue  in  his  letters  to  Brutus 2  and  in 
other  passages.  "But,"  it  maybe  urged,  "  a  bad  10 
man  will  at  times  produce  an  exordium  or  a  statement 
of  facts,  and  will  argue  a  case  in  a  manner  that 
leaves  nothing  to  be  desired."  No  doubt ;  even  a 
robber  may  fight  bravely  without  courage  ceasing  to 
be  a  virtue  ;  even  a  wicked  slave  may  bear  torture 
without  a  groan,  and  we  may  still  continue  to  regard 
endurance  of  pain  as  worthy  of  praise.  We  can 
point  to  many  acts  which  are  identical  with  those  of 
virtue,  but  spring  from  other  sources.  However, 
what  I  have  said  here  must  suffice,  as  I  have  already 
dealt  with  the  question  of  the  usefulness  of  oratory.

XXI.  As  to  the  material  of    oratory,   some   have 

»    * 

asserted  that  it  is  speech,  as  for  instance  Gorgias 1  in 
the  dialogue  of  Plato.  If  this  view  be  accepted  in 
the  sense  that  the  word  "  speech  '  is'usedof  a  dis- 
course composed  on  any  subject,  then  it  is  not  the 
material,  but  the  work,  just  as  a  statue  is  the  work 
of  the  sculptor.  For  speeches  like  statues  require 
art  for  their  production.  If  on  the  other  hand 
we  interpret  "  speech '  as  indicating  the  words 
themselves,  they  can  do  nothing  unless  they  are 
related  to  facts.  Some  again  hold  that  the  material 
consists  of  persuasive  arguments.  But  they  form 
part  of  the  work,  are  produced  by  art  and  require 
material  themselves.  Some  say  that  political  2 
questions  provide  the  material.  The  mistake  made 
by  these  lies  not  in  the  quality  of  their  opinion 
but  in  its  limitation.  For  political  questions  are 
material  for  eloquence  but  not  the  only  material. 
Some,  on  the  ground  that  rhetoric  is  a  virtue,  make  the  3 
material  with  which  it  deals  to  be  the  whole  of  life. 
Others,  on  the  ground  that  life  regarded  as  a  whole 
does  not  provide  material  for  every  virtue,  since 
most  of  them  are  concerned  only  with  departments 
of  life  (justice,  courage  and  self-control  each  having 
their  own  duties  and  their  own  end),  would  conse- 
quently restrict  oratory  to  one  particular  department 
of  life  and  place  it  in  the  practical  or  pragmatic 
department  of  ethics,  that  is  to  say  the  department 
of  morals  which  deals  with  the  business  of  life. 

For  my  own  part,  and  I  have  authority  to  support  4 
me,  I  hold  that  the  material  of  rhetoric  is  composed  of 
everything  that  may  be  placed  before  it  as  a  subject 
for    speech.      Plato,    if    I    read    him    aright,    makes 
Socrates 2  say  to  Gorgias   that   its  material  is  to  be

5  festum  est  hanc  opinionem  ipsius  Platonis  fuisse.      Et

found  in  things  not  words  ;  while  in  the  Phaedrus  l 
he  clearly  proves  that  rhetoric  is  concerned  not 
merely  with  law-courts  and  public  assemblies,  but  with 
private  and  domestic  affairs  as  well :  from  which  it  is 
obvious  that  this  was  the  view  of  Plato  himself.  Cicero  5 
also  in  a  passage  2  of  one  of  his  works,  states  that 
the  material  of  rhetoric  is  composed  of  the  things 
which  are  brought  before  it,  but  makes  certain  re- 
strictions as  to  the  nature  of  these  things.  In 
another  passage,3  however,  he  expresses  his  opinion 
that  the  orator  has  to  speak  about  all  kinds  ofthiiigs; 
I  will  quote  his  actual  words:  "although  the  very 
meaning  of  the  name  of  orator  and  the  fact  that 
he  professes  to  speak  well  seem  to  imply  a  promise 
and  undertaking  that  the  orator  will  speak  with 
elegance  and  fullness  on  any  subject  that  may  be 
put  before  him."  And  in  another  passage4  he  says,  6 
"  It  is  the  duty  of  the  true  orator  to  seek  out,  hear, 
read,  discuss,  handle  and  ponder  everything  that  be- 
falls in  the  life  of  man,  since  it  is  with  this  that  the 
orator  is  concerned  and  this  that  forms  the  material 
with  which  he  has  to  deal." 

But  this  material,  as  we  call  it,  that  is  to  say  7 
the  things  brought  before  it,  has  been  criticised  by 
some,  at  times  on  the  ground  that  it  is  limitless,  and 
sometimes  on  the  ground  that  it  is  not  peculiar  to 
oratory,  which  they  have  therefore  dubbed  a  dis- 
cursive art,  because  all  is  grist  that  comes  to  its  mill. 
I  have  no  serious  quarrel  with  these  critics,  for  they  8 
acknowledge  that  rhetoric  is  concerned  with  every 
kind  of  material,  though  they  deny  that  it  has  any 
peculiar  material  just  because  of  that  material's  mul- 
tiplicity. But  in  spite  of  this  multiplicity,  rhetoric 
is  not  unlimited  in  scope,  and  there  are  other  minor

arts  whose  material  is  characterised  by  the  same 
multiplicity:  such  for  instance  is  architecture, which 
deals  with  everything  that  is  useful  for  the  purpose 
of  building  :  such  too  is  the  engraver's  art  which 
works  on  gold,  silver,  bronze,  iron.  As  for  sculpture,  9 
its  activity  extends  to  wood,  ivory,  marble,  glass  and 
precious  stones  in  addition  to  the  materials  already 
mentioned.  And  things  which  form  the  material  for  10 
other  artists,  do  not  for  that  reason  cease  forthwith 
to  be  material  for  rhetoric.  For  if  I  ask  what  is  the 
material  of  the  sculptor,  I  shall  be  told  bronze  ;  and 
if  I  ask  what  is  the  material  of  the  maker  of  vessels 
(I  refer  to  the  craft  styled  ^aA^em-iKr/  by  the  Greeks), 
the  answer  will  again  be  bronze :  and  yet  there  is 
all  the  difference  in  the  world  between  vessels  and 
statues.  Similarly  medicine  will  not  cease  to  be  an  11 
art,  because,  like  the  art  of  the  gymnast,  it  pre- 
scribes rubbing  with  oil  and  exercise,  or  because  it 
deals  with  diet  like  the  art  of  cookery.  Again,  the  12 
objection  that  to  discourse  of  what  is  good,  expedient 
or  just  is  the  duty  of  philosophy  presents  no  diffi- 
culty. For  when  such  critics  speak  of  a  philosopher, 
they  mean  a  good  man.  Why  then  should  I  feel 
surprised  to  find  that  the  orator  whom  I  identify  with 
the  good  man  deals  with  the  same  material  ?  There  13 
is  all  the  less  reason,  since  I  have  already  shown  in 
the  first  book  !  that  philosophers  only  usurped  this 
department  of  knowledge  after  it  had  been  aban- 
doned by  the  orators :  it  was  always  the  peculiar 
property  of  rhetoric  and  the  philosophers  are  really 
trespassers.  Finally,  since  the  discussion  of  what- 
ever is  brought  before  it  is  the  task  of  dialectic, 
which  is  really  a  concise  form  of  oratory,  why  should 
not  this  task  be  regarded  as  also  being  the  appro- 
priate material  for  continuous  oratory  ?  ,

There  is  a  further  objection  made  by  certain  14 
critics,  who  say  "  Well  then. if  an  orator  has  to  speak  on 
every  subject,  he  must  be  the  master  of  all  the  arts." 
I  might  answer  this  criticism  in  the  words  of  Cicero,1 
in  whom  I  find  the  following  passage  : — •"  In  my 
opinion  no  one  can  be  an  absolutely  perfect  orator 
unless  he  has  acquired  a  knowledge  of  all  important 
subjects  and  arts."  I  however  regard  it  as  suffi- 
cient that  an  orator  should  not  be  actually  ignorant 
of  the  subject  on  which  he  has  to  speak.  For  he  15 
cannot  have  a  knowledge  of  all  causes,  and  yet  he 
should  be  able  to  speak  on  all.  On  what  then 
will  he  speak  ?  On  those  which  he  has  studied. 
Similarly  as  regards  the  arts,  he  will  study  those 
concerning  which  he  has  to  speak,  as  occasion  may 
demand,  and  will  speak  on  those  which  he  has 
studied. 

What  then  ? — I  am  asked — will  not  a  builder  16 
speak  better  on  the  subject  of  building  and  a  musi- 
cian on  music  ?  Certainly,  if  the  orator  does  not 
know  what  is  the  question  at  issue.  Even  an  illite- 
rate peasant  who  is  a  party  to  a  suit  will  speak 
better  on  behalf  of  his  case  than  an  orator  who  does 
not  know  what  the  subject  in  dispute  may  be.  But 
on  the  other  hand  if  the  orator  receive  instruction 
from  the  builder  or  the  musician,  he  will  put  for- 
ward what  he  has  thus  learned  better  than  either, 
just  as  he  will  plead  a  case  better  than  his  client, 
once  he  has  been  instructed  in  it.  The  builder  and  17 
the  musician  will,  however,  speak  on  the  subject  of 
their  respective  arts,  if  there  should  be  any  technical 
point  which  requires  to  be  established.  Neither  will 
be  an  orator,  but  he  will  perform  his  task  like  an 
orator,  just  as  when  an  untrained  person  binds  up  a

wound,  he  will  not  be  a  physician,  but  he  will  be 
acting  as  one.  Is  it  suggested  that  such  topics  18 
never  crop  up  in  panegyric,  deliberative  or  forensic 
oratory  ?  When  the  question  of  the  construction  of 
a  port  at  Ostia  came  up  for  discussion,  had  not  the 
orator  to  state  his  views?  And  yet  it  was  a  subject 
requiring  the  technical  knowledge  of  the  architect. 
Does  not  the  orator  discuss  the  question  whether  19 
livid  spots  and  swellings  on  the  body  are  sympto- 
matic of  ill-health  or  poison  ?  And  yet  that  is  a 
question  for  the  qualified  physician.  Will  he  not 
deal  with  measurements  and  figures?  And  yet  we 
must  admit  that  they  form  part  of  mathematics.  For 
my  part  I  hold  that  practically  all  subjects  are 
under  certain  circumstances  liable  to  come  up  for 
treatment  by  the  orator.  If  the  circumstances  do 
not  occur,  the  subjects  will  not  concern  him. 

We  were  therefore  right  in  asserting  that  the  20 
material  of  rhetoric  is  composed  of  everything  that 
comes  before  the  orator  for  treatment,  an  assertion 
which  is  confirmed  by  the  practice  of  everyday 
speech.  For  when  we  have  been  given  a  subject 
on  which  to  speak,  we  often  preface  our  remarks  by 
calling  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  matter  has 
been  laid  before  us.  Gorgias  indeed  felt  so  strongly  21 
that  it  was  the  orator's  duty  to  speak  on  every  sub- 
ject, that  he  used  to  allow  those  who  attended  his 
lectures  to  ask  him  questions  on  any  subject  they 
pleased.  Hermagoras  also  asserted  that  the  material 
of  oratory  lay  in  the  cause  and  the  questions  it 
involved,  thereby  including  every  subject  that  can 
be  brought  before  it.  If  he  denies  that  general  22 
questions  l  are  the  concern  of  oratory,  he  disagrees 
with  me :  but  if  they  do  concern  rhetoric,  that

supports  my  contention.  For  there  is  nothing  which 
may  not  crop  up  in  a  cause  or  appear  as  a  question 
for  discussion.  Aristotle  l  himself  also  by  his  tripartite  23 
division  of  oratory,  into  forensic,  deliberative  and 
demonstrative,  practically  brought  everything  into  the 
orator's  domain,  since  there  is  nothing  that  may  not 
come  up  for  treatment  by  one  of  these  three  kinds  of 
rhetoric. 

A  very  few  critics  have  raised  the  question  as  to  24 
what  may  be  the  instrument  of  oratory.  My  defini- 
tion of  an  instrument  is  that  without  which  the  material 
cannot  be  brought  into  the  shape  necessary  for  the  effect- 
ing of  our  object.  But  it  is  not  the  art  which  re- 
quires an  instrument,  but  the  artist.  Knowledge 
needs  no  instruments,  for  it  may  be  complete 
although  it  produces  nothing,  but  the  artist  must 
have  them.  The  engraver  cannot  work  without  his 
chisel  nor  the  painter  without  his  brush.  I  shall 
therefore  defer  this  question  until  I  come  to  treat  of 
the  orator  as  distinct  from  his  art.

1.  IN  the  second  book  the  subject  of  inquiry 
was  the  nature  and  the  end  of  rhetoric,  and  I  proved 
to  the  best  of  my  ability  that  it  was  an  art,  that  it 
was  useful,  that  it  was  a  virtue  and  that  its  material 
was  all  and  every  subject  that  might  come  up  for 
treatment.  I  shall  now  discuss  its  origin,  its  com- 
ponent parts,  and  the  method  to  be  adopted  in  hand- 
ling and  forming  our  conception  of  each.  For  most 
authors  of  text-books  have  stopped  short  of  this, 
indeed  Apollodorus  confines  himself  solely  to  forensic 
oratory.  I  know  that  those  who  asked  me  to  write  2 
this  \vork  were  specially  interested  in  that  portion  on 
which  I  am  now  entering,  and  which,  owing  to  the 
necessity  of  examining  a  great  diversity  of  opinions,  at 
once  forms  by  far  the  most  difficult  section  of  this  work, 
and  also,  I  fear,  may  be  the  least  attractive  to  my 
readers,  since  it  necessitates  a  dry  exposition  of  rules. 
In  other  portions  of  this  work  I  have  attempted  to  3 
introduce  a  certain  amount  of  ornateness,  not,  I  may 
say,  to  advertise  my  style  (if  I  had  wished  to  do  that,  I 
could  have  chosen  a  more  fertile  theme),  but  in  order 
that  I  might  thus  do  something  to  lure  our  young 
men  to  make  themselves  acquainted  with  those  prin- 
ciples which  I  regarded  as  necessary  to  the  study  of 
rhetoric  :  for  I  hoped  that  by  giving  them  something 
which  was  not  unpleasant  to  read  I  might  induce  a 
greater  readiness  to  learn  those  rules  which  I  feared

somewhat   over-sensitive.       Lucretius   has   the   same   4 
object  in  mind  when  he  states  that  he  has   set  forth 
his  philosophical  system   in  verse  ;  for  you   will  re- 
member the  well-known  simile  which  he  uses  l  : — 

"  And  as  physicians  when  they  seek  to  give 
A  draught  of  bitter  wormwood  to  a  child, 
First  smear  along  the  edge  that  rims  the  cup 
The  liquid  sweets  of  honey,  golden-hued," 

and  the  rest.  But  I  fear  that  this  book  will  have  6 
too  little  honey  and  too  much  wormwood,  and  that 
though  the  student  may  find  it  a  healthy  draught, 
it  will  be  far  from  agreeable.  I  am  also  haunted  by 
the  further  fear  that  it  will  be  all  the  less  attractive 
from  the  fact  that  most  of  the  precepts  which  it  con- 
tains are  not  original,  but  derived  from  others,  and 
because  it  is  likely  to  rouse  the  opposition  of  certain 
persons  who  do  not  share  my  views.  For  there  are 
a  large  number  of  writers,  who  though  they  are  all 
moving  toward  the  same  goal,  have  constructed 
different  roads  to  it  and  each  drawn  their  followers 
into  their  own.  The  latter,  however,  approve  of  6 
the  path  on  which  they  have  been  launched  what- 
ever its  nature,  and  it  is  difficult  to  change  the  con- 
victions implanted  in  boyhood,  for  the  excellent  reason 
that  evervbodv  prefers  to  have  learned  rather  than

to  be  in  process  of  learning.     But,  as  will  appear  in  7 
the  course  of  this  book,  there  is  an  infinite  diversity 
of  opinions  among  writers  on  this  subject,  since  some 
have   added  their  own  discoveries  to  those  portions 
of  the  art  which  were  still  shapeless  and  unformed,

and  subsequently  have  altered  even  what  was  per- 
fectly sound  in  order  to  establish  a  claim  to 
originality. 

The  first  writer  after  those  recorded  by  the  poets  8 
who  is  said  to  have  taken  any  steps  in  the  direction 
of  rhetoric  is  Empedocles.  But  the  earliest  writers 
of  text-books  are  the  Sicilians,  Corax  and  Tisias, 
who  were  followed  by  another  from  the  same  island, 
namely  Gorgias  of  Leontini,  whom  tradition  asserts 
to  have  been  the  pupil  of  Empedocles.  He,  thanks  to  9 
his  length  of  days,  for  he  lived  to  a  hundred  and  nine, 
flourished  as  the  contemporary  of  many  rhetoricians, 
was  consequently  the  rival  of  those  whom  I  have 
just  mentioned,  and  lived  on  to  survive  Socrates. 
In  the  same  period  flourished  Thrasymachus  of  10 
Chalcedon,  Prodicus  of  Ceos,  Protagoras  of  Abdera, 
for  whose  instructions,  which  he  afterwards  published 
in  a  text-book,  Euathlus  is  said  to  have  paid  10,000  1 
denarii,  Hippias  of  Elis  and  Alcidamas  of  Elaea  whom 
Plato2  calls  Palamedes.  There  was  Antiphon  also,  11 
who  was  the  first  to  write  speeches  and  who  also  wrote 
a  text-book  and  is  said  to  have  spoken  most  elo- 
quently in  his  own  defence  ;  Polycrates,  who,  as  I 
have  already  said,  wrote  a  speech  against  Socrates, 
and  Theodorus  of  Byzantium.,  who  was  one  of  those 
called  "word-artificers"  by  Plato.3  Of  these  Pro-  12 
tagoras  and  Gorgias  are  said  to  have  been  the 
first  to  treat  commonplaces,  Prodicus,  Hippias, 
Protagoras  and  Thrasymachus  the  first  to  handle 
emotional  themes.  Cicero  in  the  Brutus*  states 
that  nothing  in  the  ornate  rhetorical  style  was 
ever  committed  to  writing  before  Pericles,  and  that 
certain  of  his  speeches  are  still  extant.  For  my 
part  I  have  been  unable  to  discover  anything  in

the  least  worthy  of  his  great  reputation  for  eloquence,1 
and  am  consequently  the  less  surprised  that  there 
should  be  some  who  hold  that  he  never  committed 
anything  to  writing,  and  that  the  writings  circula- 
ting under  his  name  are  the  works  of  others.  These  13 
rhetoricians  had  many  successors,  but  the  most 
famous  of  Gorgias'  pupils  was  Isocrates,  although 
our  authorities  are  not  agreed  as  to  who  was  his 
teacher  :  I  however  accept  the  statement  of  Aristotle 
on  the  subject.  From  this  point  the  roads  begin  to  14 
part.  The  pupils  of  Isocrates  were  eminent  in  every 
branch  of  study,  and  when  he  was  already  advanced 
in  years  (and  he  lived  to  the  age  of  ninety-eight), 
Aristotle  began  to  teach  the  art  of  rhetoric  in  his 
afternoon  lectures,2  in  which  he  frequently  quoted 
the  well-known  line  from  the  Philoctetes*  in  the  form 

"  Isocrates  still  speaks.   'Twere  shame  should  I 
Sit  silent." 

Both  Aristotle  and  Isocrates  left  text-books  on 
rhetoric,  but  that  by  Aristotle  is  the  larger  and  con- 
tains more  books.  Theodectes,  whose  work  I  men- 
tioned above,  also  lived  about  the  same  period  ;  while  15 
Theophrastus,  the  pupil  of  Aristotle,  produced  some 
careful  work  on  rhetoric.  After  him  we  may  note 
that  the  philosophers,  more  especially  the  leaders  of 
the  Stoic  and  Peripatetic  schools,  surpassed  even 
the  rhetoricians  in  the  zeal  which  they  devoted  to 
the  subject.  Hermagoras  next  carved  out  a  path  of  16 
his  own,  which  numbers  have  followed :  of  his  rivals 
Athenaeus  seems  to  have  approached  him  most 

8  Probably  the  Philoctetes  of  Euripides.  The  original  line 
was  cuVxpfc"  ffiuirav,  fiap&dpovs  5'  iav  \eyfiv,  which  Aristotle 
travestied  by  substituting  'IffOKpaTrjv  for  &ap@dpovs.

nearly.  Later  still  much  work  was  done  by  Apol- 
lonius  Molon,  Areus,  Caecilius  and  Dionysius  of 
Halicarnassus.  But  the  rhetoricians  who  attracted  17 
the  most  enthusiastic  following  were  Apollodorus  of 
Pergamus,  who  was  the  instructor  of  Augustus  Caesar 
at  Apollonia,  and  Theodorus  of  Gadara,  who  preferred 
to  be  called  Theodorus  of  Rhodes  :  it  is  said  that 
Tiberius  Caesar  during  his  retirement  in  that  island 
was  a  constant  attendant  at  his  lectures.  These  18 
rhetoricians  taught  different  systems,  and  two  schools 
have  arisen  known  as  the  Apollodoreans  and  the 
Theodoreans,  these  names  being  modelled  on  the 
fashion  of  nomenclature  in  vogue  with  certain  schools 
of  philosophy.  The  doctrines  of  Apollodorus  are 
best  learned  from  his  pupils,  among  whom  Cains 
Valgius  was  the  best  interpreter  of  his  master's  views 
in  Latin,  Atticus  in  Greek.  The  only  text-book  by 
Apollodorus  himself  seems  to  be  that  addressed  to 
Matius,  as  his  letter  to  Domitius  does  not  acknow- 
ledge the  other  works  attributed  to  him.  The 
writings  of  Theodorus  were  more  numerous,  and 
there  are  some  still  living  who  have  seen  his  pupil 
Hermagoras. 

The  first  Roman  to  handle  the  subject  was,  to  the  19 
best  of  my  belief,  Marcus  Cato,  the  famous  censor, 
while  after  him  Marcus  Antonius  began  a  treatise  on 
rhetoric  :  I  say  "  began,"  because  only  this  one  work  of 
his  survives,  and  that  is  incomplete.  He  was  followed 
by  others  of  less  note,  whose  names  I  will  not  omit  to 
mention,  should  occasion  demand.  But  it  was  Cicero  20 
who  shed  the  greatest  light  not  only  on  the  practice 
but  on  the  theory  of  oratory ;  for  he  stands  alone 
among  Romans  as  combining  the  gift  of  actual  elo- 
quence with  that  of  teaching  the  art.  With  him  for

predecessor  it  would  be  more  modest  to  be  silent,  but 
for  the  fact  that  he  himself  describes  his  Rhetorica1 
as  a  youthful  indiscretion,  while  in  his  later  works  on 
oratory  he  deliberately  omitted  the  discussion  of 
certain  minor  points,  on  which  instruction  is  generally 
desired.  Cornificius  wrote  a  good  deal,  Stertinius  21 
something,  and  the  elder  Gallic  a  little  on  the  same 
subject.  But  Gallio's  predecessors,  Celsus  and  Laenas, 
and  in  our  own  day  Verginius,  Pliny  and  Tutilius, 
have  treated  rhetoric  with  greater  accuracy.  Even 
to-day  we  have  some  distinguished  writers  on  oratory 
who,  if  they  had  dealt  with  the  subject  more  com- 
prehensively, would  have  saved  me  the  trouble  of 
writing  this  book.  But  I  will  spare  the  names  of  the 
living.  The  time  will  come  when  they  will  reap  their 
meed  of  praise  ;  for  their  merits  will  endure  to  after 
generations,  while  the  calumnies  of  envy  will  perish 
utterly. 

Still,  although  so  many  writers  have  preceded  me,  22 
I  shall  not  shrink  from  expressing  my  own  opinion  on 
certain  points.  I  am  not  a  superstitious  adherent  of 
any  school,  and  as  this  book  will  contain  a  collection 
of  the  opinions  of  many  different  authors,  it  was  de- 
sirable to  leave  it  to  my  readers  to  select  what  they 
will.  I  shall  be  content  if  they  praise  me  for  my 
industry,  wherever  there  is  no  scope  for  originality. 

II.  The  question  as  to  the  origin  of  rhetoric  need 
not  keep  us  long.  For  who  can  doubt  that  mankind 
received  the  gift  of  speech  from  nature  at  its  birth 
(for  we  can  hardly  go  further  back  than  that),  while 
the  usefulness  of  speech  brought  improvement  and 
study,  and  finally  method  and  exercise  gave  per- 
fection ?  I  cannot  understand  why  some  hold  that  2 
the  elaboration  of  speech  originated  in  the  fact  that 


QUINTILIAN 

quidam  inde  coepisse,  quod  ii,  qui  in  discrimen 
aliquod  vocabantur,  accuratius  loqui  defendendi  sui 
gratia  instituerint.  Haec  enim  ut  honestior  causa, 
ita  non  utique  prior  est,  cum  praesertim  accusatio 
praecedat  defensionem;  nisi  quis  dicet,  etiam  gladium 
fabricatum  ab  eo  prius,  qui  ferrum  in  tutelam  sui 

3  quam  qui  in  perniciem  alterius  compararit.      Initium 
ergo  dicendi  dedit  natura,  initium  artis  observatio. 
Homines  enim,  sicuti  in  medicina,  cum  viderent  alia 
salubria,  alia  insalubria,  ex  observatione  eorum  effe- 
cerunt  artem,   ita,  cum   in  dicendo    alia   utilia,   alia 
inutilia  deprehenderent,  notarunt  ea  ad  imitandum 
vitandumque,  et  quaedam  secunduni  rationem  eorum 
adiecerunt  ipsi  quoque ;   haec   confirmata   sunt   usu, 

4  turn   quae   sciebat   quisque   docuit.      Cicero   quidem 
initium  orandi  conditoribus  urbium  ac  legum  latori- 
bus  dedit,  in  quibus  fuisse  vim  dicendi  necesse  est ; 
cur  tamen  hanc  primam  originem  putet,  non  video, 
cum  sint  adhuc  quaedam   vagae  et  sine  urbibus  ac 
sine  legibus  gentes,  et  tamen  qui  sunt  in  iis  nati  et 
legationibus     fungantur    et    accusent    aliqua    atque 
defendant    et     denique    alium     alio     melius    loqui 
credant.

BOOK    III.  ii,  2-in.  2 

those  who  were  in  peril  owing  to  some  accusation 
being  made  against  them,  set  themselves  to  speak 
with  studied  care  for  the  purpose  of  their  own  de- 
fence. This,  however,  though  a  more  honour- 
able origin,  cannot  possibly  be  the  earlier,  for 
accusation  necessarily  precedes  defence.  You  might 
as  well  assert  that  the  sword  was  invented  for  the 
purpose  of  self-defence  and  not  for  aggression.  It  3 
was,  then,  nature  that  created  speech,  and  observa- 
tion that  originated  the  art  of  speaking.  Just  as  men 
discovered  the  art  of  medicine  by  observing  that  some 
things  were  healthy  and  some  the  reverse,  so  they 
observed  that  some  things  were  useful  and  some  use- 
less in  speaking,  and  noted  them  for  imitation  or 
avoidance,  while  they  added  certain  other  precepts 
according  as  their  nature  suggested.  These  observa- 
tions were  confirmed  by  experience  and  each  man 
proceeded  to  teach  what  he  knew.  Cicero,1  it  is  4 
true,  attributes  the  origin  of  oratory  to  the  founders 
of  cities  and  the  makers  of  laws,  who  must  needs 
have  possessed  the  gift  of  eloquence.  But  why  he 
thinks  this  the  actual  origin,  I  cannot  understand, 
since  there  still  exist  certain  nomad  peoples  without 
cities  or  laws,  and  yet  members  of  these  peoples  per- 
form the  duties  of  ambassadors,  accuse  and  defend, 
and  regard  one  man  as  a  better  speaker  than 
another. 

III.  The  art  of  oratory,  as  taught  by  most  authori- 
ties, and  those  the  best,  consists  of  five  parts : — 
invention,  arrangement,  expression,  memory,  and  delivery 
or  action  (the  two  latter  terms  being  used  synonym- 
ously). But  all  speech  expressive  of  purpose  involves 
also  a  subject  and  words.  If  such  expression  is  brief  2

brevis  et  una  conclusione  finitus,  nihil  fortasse  ultra

turn  enim  refert,  quid  et  quo  modo  dicamus,  sed 
etiam  quo  loco ;  opus  ergo  est  et  dispositione.  Sed

quaeque  loco  poterimus  nisi  adiuvante  memoria ;

cuncta   corrumpit   ac    propemodum   perdit    indecora 
vel  voce  vel  gestu  pronuntiatlo.      Huic  quoque  igitur 
tribuendus  est  necessario  quintus  locus. 

4  Nee   audiendi  quidam,  quorum   est  Albutius,   qui 
tris  modo   primas   esse   partes  volunt,  quoniam  me- 
moria atque  actio  natura  non  arte  contingant  (quarum 
nos  praecepta  suo  loco  dabimus),  licet  Thrasymachus 

5  quoque  idem  de  actione  crediderit.      His  adiecerunt 
quidam  sextam   partem,   ita   ut   inventioni  iudicium 
subnecterent,   quia   primum    esset    invenire,   deinde 
iudicare.      Ego  porro  ne  invenisse  quidem  credo  eum, 
qui  non  iudicavit ;  neque  enim  contraria,  communia, 
stulta  invenisse  dicitur  quisquam,   sed    non   vitasse. 

6  Et   Cicero  quidem    in    Rhetoricis    iudicium    subiecit 
inventioni ;  mihi  autem  adeo  tribus  primis  partibus 
videtur  esse  permixtum  (nam  neque  dispositio  sine 
eo  neque  elocutio  fuerit),  ut  pronuntiationem  quoque

and  contained  within  the  limits  of  one  sentence,  it 
may  demand  nothing  more,  but  longer  speeches 
require  much  more.  For  not  only  what  we  say 
and  how  we  say  it  is  of  importance,  but  also 
the  circumstances  under  which  wre  say  it.  It  is  here 
that  the  need  of  arrangement  comes  in.  But  it  will 
be  impossible  to  say  everything  demanded  by  the 
subject,  putting  each  thing  in  its  proper  place,  without 
the  aid  of  memory.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  memory  3 
forms  the  fourth  department.  But  a  delivery,  which 
is  rendered  unbecoming  either  by  voice  or  gesture, 
spoils  everything  and  almost  entirely  destroys  the 
effect  of  what  is  said.  Delivery  therefore  must  be 
assigned  the  fifth  place. 

Those  (and  Albutius  is  among  them),  who  maintain  4 
that  there  are  only  three  departments  on  the  ground 
that  memory  and  delivery   (for  which   I   shall  give 
instructions  in  their  proper  place  *)  are  given  us  by 
nature   not   by    art,   may    be   disregarded,   although 
Thrasymachus  held  the   same   views   as  regards  de- 
livery.    Some  have  added  a  sixth  department,  sub-  5 
joining  judgment  to  invention,  on  the  ground  that  it  is 
necessary  first  to  invent  and  then  to  exercise  our  judg- 
ment.  For  my  own  part  I  do  not  believe  that  invention 
can  exist  apart  from  judgment,since  we  do  not  say  that  a 
speaker  has  invented  inconsistent,  two-edged  or  foolish 
arguments,   but   merely  that  he   has  failed  to  avoid 
them.      It  is  true  that  Cicero  in  his  Rhetorica2  in-  6 
eludes  judgment  under  invention  ;    but  in  my  opinion 
judgment  is   so   inextricably  mingled   with    the    first 
three  departments  of  rhetoric  (for  without  judgment 
neither  expression  nor  arrangement  are  possible),  that 
I  think  that  even   delivery  owes   much   to  it.      I  say  7 
this  with  all  the  greater  confidence  because  Cicero  in

his  Partitiones  oratoriae1  arrives  at  the  same  five-fold 
division  of  which  I  have  just  spoken.  For  after  an 
initial  division  of  oratory  into  invention  and  expression, 
he  assigns  matter  and  arrangement  to  invention,  icords 

c^  O 

and  delivery  to  expression,  and  makes  memory  a  fifth 
department  common  to  them  all  and  acting  as  their 
guardian.  Again  in  the  Orator'1  he  states  that  elo- 

o  " 

quence  consists  of  five  things,  and  in  view  of  the  fact 
that  this  is  a  later  work  we  may  accept  this  as  his 
more  settled  opinion.  Others,  who  seem  to  me  to  8 
have  been  no  less  desirous  than  those  mentioned 
above  to  introduce  some  novelty,  have  added  order, 
although  they  had  already  mentioned  arrangement, 
as  though  arrangement  was  anything  else  than  the 
marshalling  of  arguments  in  the  best  possible  order. 
Dion  taught  that  oratory  consisted  only  of  invention 
and  arrangement,  but  added  that  each  of  these  depart- 
ments was  twofold  in  nature,  being  concerned  with 
words  and  things,  so  that  expression  comes  under 
invention,  and  delivery  under  arrangement,  while  memory 
must  be  added  as  a  fifth  department.  The  followers 
of  Theodorus  divide  invention  into  two  parts,  the  one 
concerned  with  matter  and  the  other  with  expression, 
and  then  add  the  three  remaining  departments. 
Hermagoras  places  judgment,  division,  order  and  9 
everything  relating  to  expression  under  the  heading 
of  economy,  a  Greek  word  meaning  the  management 
of  domestic  affairs  which  is  applied  metaphorically  to 
oratory  and  has  no  Latin  equivalent. 

A    further    question    arises    at    this    point,    since  10 
some   make  memory    follow   invention  in    the    list    of 
departments,  while  others  make  it  follow  arrangement. 
Personally  1  prefer  to  place  it  fourth.     For  we  ought 
not  merely  to  retain  in  our  minds  the  fruits  of  our

verbis  formata  memoriae  mandare  debemus.  Hac 
enira  omnia,  quaecunque  in  orationem  collata  sunt, 
continentur. 

11  Fuerunt  etiam  in  hac  opinione  non  pauci,  ut  has 
non   rhetorices   partes    esse   existimarent   sed   opera 
oratoris  ;  eius  enim  esse  invenire,  disponere,  eloqui

Nam  bene  dicere  est  oratoris,  rhetorice  tamen  erit 
bene  dicendi  scientia ;  vel,  ut  alii  putant,  artificis  est 
persuadere,  vis  autem  persuadendi  artis.      Ita  inve- 
nire quidem  et  disponere  oratoris,  inventio  autem  et

plures  dissenserunt,  utrumne  hae  partes  essent  rhe- 
torices an   eiusdem  opera  an,  ut  Atlienaeus  credit,

non  ab  aliis  perficiuntur,  sed  aliud  ipsa  perficiunt :

non  potest  ut,  cum  totum  ex  partibus  constet,  non 
sint    partes    totius    ex    quibus    constat.       Videntur

invention,  in  order  that  we  may  be  able  to  arrange 
them,  or  to  remember  our  arrangement  in  order  that 
we  may  express  it,  but  we  must  also  commit  to 
memory  the  words  which  we  propose  to  use,  since 
memory  embraces  everything  that  goes  to  the  com- 
position of  a  speech. 

There  are  also  not  a  few  who  have  held  that  these  11 
are  not  parts  of  rhetoric,  but  rather  duties  to  be 
observed  by  the  orator.  For  it  is  his  business  to 
invent,  arrange,  express,  etcetera.  If,  however,  we 
accept  this  view,  we  leave  nothing  to  art.  For  12 
although  the  orator's  task  is  to  speak  well,  rhetoric 
is  the  science  of  speaking  well.  Or  if  we  adopt 
another  view,  the  task  of  the  artist  is  to  persuade, 
while  the  power  of  persuasion  resides  in  the  art. 
Consequently,  while  it  is  the  duty  of  the  orator  to 
invent  and  arrange,  invention  and  arrangement  may  be 
regarded  as  belonging  to  rhetoric.  At  this  point  13 
there  has  been  much  disagreement,  as  to  whether 
these  are  parts  or  duties  of  rhetoric,  or,  as  Athenaeus 
believes,  elements  of  rhetoric,  which  the  Greeks  call 
crroLx^ia.  But  they  cannot  correctly  be  called  ele- 
ments. For  in  that  case  we  should  have  to  regard 
them  merely  as  first-principles,  like  the  moisture,  fire, 
matter  or  atoms  of  which  the  universe  is  said  to  be 
composed.  Nor  is  it  correct  to  call  them  duties,  since 
they  are  not  performed  by  others,  but  perform  some- 
thing themselves.  We  must  therefore  conclude  that 
they  are  parts.  For  since  rhetoric  is  composed  of  14 
them,  it  follows  that,  since  a  whole  consists  of  parts, 
these  must  be  parts  of  the  whole  which  they  com- 
pose. Those  who  have  called  them  duties  seem  to 
me  lo  have  been  further  influenced  by  the  fact  that 
they  wished  to  reserve  the  name  of  parts  for  another

division  of  rhetoric  :  for  they  asserted  that  the  parts 
of  rhetoric  were,  panegyric,  deliberative  and  forensic 
oratory.  But  if  these  are  parts,  they  are  parts  rather 
of  the  material  than  of  the  art.  For  each  of  them  15 
contains  the  whole  of  rhetoric,  since  each  of  them 
requires  invention,  arrangement,  expression,  memory  and 
delivery.  Consequently  some  writers  have  thought 
it  better  to  say  that  there  are  three  kinds  of  oratory; 
those  whom  Cicero !  has  followed  seem  to  me  to 
have  taken  the  wisest  course  in  terming  them  kinds 


of  causes. 


IV.  There  is,  however,  a  dispute  as  to  whether 
there  are  three  kinds  or  more.  But  it  is  quite  cer- 
tain that  all  the  most  eminent  authorities  among 
ancient  writers,  following  Aristotle  who  merely  sub- 
stituted the  term  public  for  deliberative,  have  been 
content  with  the  threefold  division.  Still  a  feeble  2 
attempt  has  been  made  by  certain  Greeks  and  by 
Cicero  in  his  de  Oratore,2  to  prove  that  there  are  not 
merely  more  than  three,  but  that  the  number  of 
kinds  is  almost  past  calculation  :  and  this  view  has 
almost  been  thrust  down  our  throats  by  the  greatest 
authority3  of  our  own  times.  Indeed  if  we  place  the  3 
task  of  praise  and  denunciation  in  the  third  division, 
on  what  kind  of  oratory  are  we  to  consider  ourselves 
to  be  employed,  when  we  complain,  console,  pacify, 
excite,  terrify,  encourage,  instruct,  explain  obscurities, 
narrate,  plead  for  mercy,  thank,  congratulate,  re- 
proach, abuse,  describe,  command,  retract,  express 
our  desires  and  opinions,  to  mention  no  other  of  the 
many  possibilities  ?  As  an  adherent  of  the  older  view  4 
I  must  ask  for  indulgence  and  must  enquire  what  was 
the  reason  that  led  earlier  writers  to  restrict  a  subject

of  such  variety  to  such  narrow"  bounds.     Those  who 
think  such   authorities  in  error  hold  that  they  were 
influenced    by    the    fact   that   these    three    subjects 
practically  exhausted  the  range  of  ancient  oratory. 
For  it  was  customary  to  write  panegyrics  and  denun-  5 
ciations  and  to  deliver   funeral   orations,   while  the 
greater  part  of  their  activities  was  devoted  to  the 
law-courts  and  deliberative  assemblies ;  as  a  result, 
they  say,  the  old  writers  of  text-books  only  included 
those  kinds  of  oratory  which  were  most  in  vogue.  The  6 
defenders  of  antiquity  point  out  that  there  are  three 
kinds  of  audience  :  one  which  comes  simply  for  the 
sake  of  getting  pleasure,  a  second  which  meets  to  re- 
ceive advice,  a  third  to  give  judgement  on  causes. 
In  the  course  of  a  thorough  enquiry  into  the  question 
it  has  occurred  to  me  that  the  tasks  of  oratory  must 
either  be  concernedwith  the  law-courts  or  with  themes 
lying    outside    the    law-courts.      The  nature  of   the  7 
questions  into  which  enquiry  is  made  in  the  courts  is 
obvious.     As  regards  those   matters    which    do    not 
come  before  a  judge,   they  must  necessarily  be  con- 
cerned either  with  the  past  or  the  future.    We  praise 
or  denounce  past  actions,  we  deliberate  about  the 
future.      Again    everything   on    which    we    have    to  8 
speak  must  be  either  certain  or  doubtful.     We  praise 
or  blame  what  is  certain,  as  our  inclination  leads  us  : 
on  the  other  hand  where  doubt  exists,  in  some  cases 
we  are  free  to  form  our  own  views,  and  it  is  here  that 
deliberation  comes  in,  while  in  others,   we  leave  the 
problem  to  the  decision  of  others,  and  it  is  on  these 
that  litigation  takes  place. 

Anaximenes  regarded  forensic  and  public  oratory  9 
as  genera  but  held  that  there  were  seven  species : — 
exhortation,  dissuasion,  praise,  denunciation,  accusa-

tion,  defence,  inquiry,  or  as  he  called  it 
The  first  two,  however,  clearly  belong  to  delibera- 
tive, the  next  to  demonstrative,  the  three  last  to 
forensic  oratory.  I  say  nothing  of  Protagoras,  who  10 
held  that  oratory  was  to  be  divided  only  into  the 
following  heads  :  question  and  answer,  command  and 
entreaty,  or  as  he  calls  it  ev^ojX^.  Plato  in  his 
Sophist  A  in  addition  to  public  and  forensic  oratory 
introduces  a  third  kind  which  he  styles  7rpo<ro^.iX^rtKT;, 
which  I  will  permit  myself  to  translate  by  "conver- 
sational." This  is  distinct  from  forensic  oratory  and 
is  adapted  for  private  discussions,  and  we  may  regard 
it  as  identical  with  dialectic.  Isocrates2  held  that  11 
praise  and  blame  find  a  place  in  every  kind  of 
oratory. 

The  safest  and  most  rational  course  seems  to  be  to  1? 
follow  the  authority  of  the  majority.  There  is, 
then,  as  I  have  said,  one  kind  concerned  with  praise 
and  blame,  which,  however,  derives  its  name  from 
the  better  of  its  two  functions  and  is  called  lauda- 
tory ;  others  however  call  it  demonstrative.  Both 
names  are  believed  to  be  derived  from  the  Greek  in 
which  the  corresponding  terms  are  encomiastic,  and 
epideictic.  The  term  cpidcictic  seems  to  me  however  13 
to  imply  display  rather  than  demonstration,  and  to 
have  a  very  different  meaning  from  encomiastic.  For 
although  it  includes  laudatory  oratory,  it  does  not 
confine  itself  thereto.  Will  any  one  deny  the  title  14 
of  epideictic  to  panegyric  ?  But  yet  panegyrics  are  ad- 
visory in  form  and  frequently  discuss  the  interests 
of  Greece.  We  may  therefore  conclude  that,  while 
there  are  three  kinds  of  oratory,  all  three  devote 
themselves  in  part  to  the  matter  in  hand,  and  in 
part  to  display.  But  it  may  be  that  Romans  are  not

borrowing  from  Greek  when  they  apply  the  title 
demonstrative,  but  are  merely  led  to  do  so  because 
praise  and  blame  demonstrate  the  nature  of  the 
object  with  which  they  are  concerned.  The  second  15 
kind  is  deliberative,  the  third  forensic  oratory.  All 
other  species  fall  under  these  three  genera  :  you  will 
not  find  one  in  which  we  have  not  to  praise  or 
blame,  to  advise  or  dissuade,  to  drive  home  or  refute 
a  charge,  while  conciliation,  narration,  proof,  exag- 
geration, extenuation,  and  the  moulding  of  the  minds 
of  the  audience  by  exciting  or  alh'.ving  their  pas- 
sions, are  common  to  all  three  kinds  of  oratory.  1  16 
cannot  even  agree  with  those  who  hold  that  lauda- 
tory subjects  are  concerned  with  the  question  of 
what  is  honourable,  deliberative  with  the  question  of 
what  is  expedient,  and  forensic  with  the  question  of 
what  is  just :  the  division  thus  made  is  easy  and 
neat  rather  than  true  :  for  all  three  kinds  rely  on 
the  mutual  assistance  of  the  other.  For  we  deal 
with  justice  and  expediency  in  panegyric  and  with 
honour  in  deliberations,  while  you  will  rarely  find  a 
forensic  case,  in  part  of  which  at  any  rate  something 
of  those  questions  just  mentioned  is  not  to  be  found. 
V.  Every  speech  however  consists  at  once  of  that 
which  is  expressed  and  that  which  expresses,  that  is 
to  say  of  matter  and  words.  Skill  in  speaking  is 
perfected  by  nature,  art  and  practice,  to  which  some 
add  a  fourth  department,  namely  imitation,  which  I 
however  prefer  to  include  under  art.  There  are  also  2 
three  aims  which  the  orator  must  always  have  in 
view  ;  he  must  instruct,  move  and  charm  his  hearers. 
This  is  a  clearer  division  than  that  made  by  those 

•/ 

who  divide  the  task  of  oratory  into  that  which  relates 
to  things  and    that  which   concerns  the  emotions,

since  both  of  these  will  not  always  be  present  in  the 
subjects  which  we  shall  have  to  treat.  For  some 
themes  are  far  from  calling  for  any  appeal  to  the 
emotions,  which,  although  room  cannot  always  be 
found  for  them,  produce  a  most  powerful  effect 
wherever  they  do  succeed  in  forcing  their  way.  The  3 
best  authorities  hold  that  there  are  some  things  in 
oratory  which  require  proof  and  others  which  do  not, 
a  view  with  which  I  agree.  Some  on  the  other  hand, 
as  for  instance  Celsus,  think  that  the  orator  will  not 
speak  on  any  subject  unless  there  is  some  question 
involved  in  it ;  but  the  majority  of  writers  on  rhetoric 
are  against  him,  as  is  also  the  threefold  division  of 

O  * 

oratory,  unless  indeed  to  praise  what  is  allowed  to  be 
honourable  and  to  denounce  what  is  admittedly  dis- 
graceful are  no  part  of  an  orator's  duty. 

It  is,  however,  universally  agreed  that  all  questions  4 
must  be    concerned   either  with   something  that  is 
written  or  something  that  is  not.   Those  concerned  with 
what  is  written  are  questions  of  law,  those  which  con- 
cern what  is  not  written  are  questions  of  fact.   Herma- 
goras  calls  the   latter  rational   questions,  the  former 
legal  questions,  for  so  we  may  translate  AoytKoV  and 
vofMtKov.     Those  who  hold   that  every  question   con-  5 
cerns  either  things  or  words,  mean  much  the  same. 

It  is  also  agreed  that  questions  are  either  definite 
or  indefinite.  Inde/initec[uest\OTis  are  those  which  may 
be  maintained  or  impugned  without  reference  to 
persons,  time  or  place  and  the  like.  The  Greeks  call 
them  theses,  Cicero1  propositions,  others  general  questions 
relating  to  civil  life,  others  again  questions  suited  for 
philosophical  discussion,  while  Athenaeus  calls  them 
parts  of  a  cause.  Cicero 2  distinguishes  two  kinds,  6 
the  one  concerned  with  knowledge,  the  other  with 
action.  Thus  "  Is  the  world  governed  by  pro-

vidence  ?  "  is  a  question  of  knowledge,  while  "  Should 
we  enter  politics  ? '  is  a  question  of  action.  The 
first  involves  three  questions,  whether  a  thing 
is,  what  it  is,  and  of  what  nature  :  for  all  these 
things  may  be  unknown  :  the  second  involves  two, 
how  to  obtain  power  and  how  to  use  it.  Definite  1 
questions  involve  facts,  persons,  time  and  the  like. 
The  Greeks  call  them  hypotheses,  while  we  call  them 
causes.  In  these  the  whole  question  turns  on  per- 
sons and  facts.  An  indefinite  question  is  always  the  8 
more  comprehensive,  since  it  is  from  the  indefinite 
question  that  the  definite  is  derived.  I  will  illustrate 
what  I  mean  by  an  example.  The  question  "  Should 
a  man  marry?"  is  indefinite;  the  question  "Should 
Cato  marry  ?  "  is  definite,  and  consequently  may  be 
regarded  as  a  subject  for  a  deliberative  theme.  But 
even  those  which  have  no  connexion  with  particular 
persons  are  generally  given  a  specific  reference. 
For  instance  the  question  "  Ought  we  to  take  a  share 
in  the  government  of  our  country  ? '  is  abstract, 
whereas  "  Ought  we  to  take  part  in  the  government 
of  our  country  under  the  sway  of  a  tyrant  ?  '  has  a 
specific  reference.  But  in  this  latter  case  we  may  9 
say  that  a  person  is  tacitly  implied.  For  the 
mention  of  a  tyrant  doubles  the  question,  and 
there  is  an  implicit  admission  of  time  and  quality  ; 
but  all  the  same  you  would  scarcely  be  justified  in 
calling  it  a  cause  or  definite  question.  Those  ques- 
tions which  I  have  styled  indefinite  are  also  called 
general :  if  this  is  correct,  we  shall  have  to  call  definite 
questions  special  questions.  But  in  every  special 
question  the  general  question  is  implicit,  since  the 
genus  is  logically  prior  to  the  species.  And  perhaps  10 
even  in  actual  causes  wherever  the  notion  of  quality 
comes  into  question,  there  is  a  certain  intrusion  of

the  abstract.  "  Milo  killed  Clodius  :  he  was  justified 
in  killing  one  who  lay  in  wait  for  him."  Does  not 
this  raise  the  general  question  as  to  whether  we 
have  the  rig-lit  to  kill  a  man  who  lies  in  wait  for  us? 

o 

What  again  of  conjectures?  May  not  they  be  of  a 
general  character,  as  for  instance,  "  What  was  the 
motive  for  the  crime  ?  hatred  ?  covetousness  ?  '  or 
"  Are  we  justified  in  believing  confessions  made  under 
torture  ?  '  or  "  Which  should  carry  greater  weight, 
evidence  or  argument  ?  '  As  for  definitions,  every- 
thing that  they  contain  is  undoubtedly  of  a  general 
nature.  There  are  some  who  hold  that  even  those  11 
questions  which  have  reference  to  persons  and  par- 
ticular cases  may  at  times  be  called  theses,  provided 
only  they  are  put  slightly  differently  :  for  instance, 
if  Orestes  be  accused,  we  shall  have  a  cause  :  whereas 
if  it  is  put  as  question,  namely  "  Was  Orestes  rightly 
acquitted?"  it  will  be  a  thesis.  To  the  same  class 
as  this  last  belongs  the  question  "  Was  Cato  right 
in  transferring  Marcia  to  Hortensius?"  These  per- 
sons distinguish  a  thesis  from  a  cause  as  follows  :  a 
thesis  is  theoretical  in  character,  while  a  cause  has 
relation  to  actual  facts,  since  in  the  former  case  we 
argue  merely  with  a  view  to  abstract  truth,  while  in 
the  latter  we  have  to  deal  with  some  particular  act. 

Some,  however,  think  that  general  questions  are  12 
useless  to  an  orator,  since  no  profit  is  to  be  derived 
from  proving  that  we  ought  to  marry  or  to  take 
part  in  politics,  if  we  are  prevented  from  so  doing 
by  age  or  ill  health.  But  not  all  general  questions 
are  liable  to  this  kind  of  objection.  For  instance 
questions  such  as  "  Is  virtue  an  end  in  itself?'  or 
"  Is  the  world  governed  by  providence  ?  '  cannot 
be  countered  in  this  way.  Further  in  questions  13

which  have  reference  to  a  particular  person,  although 
it  is  not  sufficient  merely  to  handle  the  general 
question,  we  cannot  arrive  at  any  conclusion  on 
the  special  point  until  we  have  first  discussed  the 
general  question.  For  how  is  Cato  to  deliberate 
"whether  he  personally  is  to  marry,"  unless  the 
general  question  "whether  marriage  is  desirable' 
is  first  settled  ?  And  how  is  he  to  deliberate 
"  whether  he  should  marry  Marcia,"  unless  it  is 
proved  that  it  is  the  duty  of  Cato  to  marry?  There  14 
are,  however,  certain  books  attributed  to  Herma- 
goras  which  support  this  erroneous  opinion,  though 
whether  the  attribution  is  spurious  or  whether  they 
were  written  by  another  Hermagoras  is  an  open 
question.  For  they  cannot  possibly  be  by  the 
famous  Hermagoras,  who  wrote  so  much  that  was 
admirable  on  the  art  of  rhetoric,  since,  as  is  clear 
from  the  first  book  of  the  Rhetorica  of  Cicero,1  he 
divided  the  material  of  rhetoric  into  theses  and  causes. 
Cicero  objects  to  this  division,  contends  that  theses 
have  nothing1  to  do  with  an  orator,  and  refers  all 

O  ' 

this  class  of  questions  to  the  philosophers.  But  15 
Cicero  has  relieved  me  of  any  feeling  of  shame 
that  I  might  have  in  controverting  his  opinion,  since 
he  has  not  only  expressed  his  disapproval  of  his  Rhe- 
torica, but  in  the  Orator?  the  de  Oratore  and  the 
Topica3  instructs  us  to  abstract  such  discussions 
from  particular  persons  and  occasions,  "  because 
we  can  speak  more  fully  on  general  than  on  special 
themes,  and  because  what  is  proved  of  the  whole 
must  also  be  proved  of  the  part."  In  all  general  16 
questions,  however,  the  essential  basis  is  the  same  as 
in  a  cause  or  definite  question.  It  is  further 
pointed  out  that  there  are  some  questions  which

concern  "  things  in  themselves,"  while  others  have 
a  particular  reference  ;  an  example  of  the  former 
will  be  the  question  "  Should  a  man  marry  ?  "  of  the 
latter  "  Should  an  old  man  marry  ?  "  ;  or  again  the 
question  whether  a  man  is  brave  will  illustrate  the 
first,  while  the  question  whether  lie  is  braver  than 
another  will  exemplify  the  second. 

Apollodorus  defines  a  cause  in  the  following  terms  17 
(I  quote  the  translation  of  his  pupil  Valgius)  : — "A 
cause  is  a  matter  which  in  all  its  parts  bears  on  the 
question  at  issue,"  or  again  "a  cause  is  a  matter  of 
which  the  question  in  dispute  is  the  object." 
He  then  defines  a  matter  in  the  following  terms  :— 
"A  matter  is  a  combination  of  persons,  circumstances 
of  place  and  time,  motives,  means,  incidents,  acts, 
instruments,  speeches,  the  letter  and  the  spirit  of  the 
law.  Let  us  then  understand  a  cause  in  the  sense  of  18 
the  Greek  hypothesis  or  subject,  and  a  matter  in  the 
sense  of  the  Greek  peristasis  or  collection  of  circum- 
stances. But  some,  however,  have  defined  a  cause  in 
the  same  way  that  Apollodorus  defines  a  matter. 
Isocrates  l  on  the  other  hand  defines  a  cause  as  some 
definite  question  concerned  with  some  point  of  civil  affairs, 
or  a  dispute  in  whicli  definite  persons  are  involved  ;  while 
Cicero'2  uses  the  following  words  : — "A  cause  may  be 
known  by  its  being  concerned  with  certain  definite 
persons,  circumstances  of  time  and  place,  actions,  and 
business,  and  will  relate  either  to  all  or  at  any  rate  to 
most  of  these." 

VI.3  Since  every  cause,  then,  has  a  certain  essential 
basis  4  on  which  it  rests,  before  I  proceed  to  set  forth 
how  each  kind  of  cause  should  be  handled,  I  think  I 

4  There  is  no  exact  English  equivalent  for  status.    Basis  or 
ground  are  perhaps  the  nearest  equivalents.

should  first  examine  a  question  that  is  common  to  all 
of  them,  namely,  what  is  meant  by  basis,  whence  it 
is  derived  and  how  many  and  of  what  nature  such 
bases  may  be.  Some,  it  is  true,  have  thought  that 
they  were  peculiar  merely  to  forensic  themes,  but 
their  ignorance  will  stand  revealed  when  I  have 
treated  of  all  three  kinds  of  oratory.  That  which  I  2 
call  the  basis  some  style  the  constitution,  others  the 
question,  and  others  again  that  which  may  be  inferred 
from  the  question,  while  Theodorus  calls  it  the  most  gen- 
eral head,  K€<£a\cuov  yeviKamrrov,  to  which  everything 
must  be  referred.  These  different  names,  however,  all 
mean  the  same  thing,  nor  is  it  of  the  least  importance 
to  students  by  what  special  name  things  are  called, 
as  long  as  the  thing  itself  is  perfectly  clear.  The  3 
Greeks  call  this  essential  basis  (rrcum,  a  name  which 
they  hold  was  not  invented  by  Hermagoras,  but 
according  to  some  was  introduced  by  Naucrates,  the 
pupil  of  Isocrates,  according  to  others  by  Zopyrus  of 
Clazomenae,  although  Aeschines  in  his  speech  against 
Ctesiphon1  seems  to  employ  the  word,  when  he  asks 
the  jury  not  to  allow  Demosthenes  to  be  irrelevant 
but  to  keep  him  to  the  stasis  or  basis  of  the  case. 
The  term  seems  to  be  derived  from  the  fact  that  it  4 
is  on  it  that  the  first  collision  between  the  parties  to 
the  dispute  takes  place,  or  that  it  forms  the  basis  or 
standing  of  the  whole  case.  So  much  for  the  origin  of 
the  name.  Now  for  its  nature.  Some  have  defined 
the  basis  as  being  \\\e  first  conflict  of  the  causes.  The 
idea  is  correct,  but  the  expression  is  faulty.  For  the  6 
essential  basis  is  not  the  first  conflict,  which  we  may 
represent  by  the  clauses  "  You  did  such  and  such 
a  thing"  and  "I  did  not  do  it."  It  is  rather  the 
kind  of  question  which  arises  from  the  first  conflict,

"I  did  not,"  "Did  he  do  it?,"  or  "You  did  this,"  "I

that  the  contending  parties  rest  their  respective  cases 
on  these  points  :  the  bases  of  these  questions  will 
therefore  be  of  a  conjectural  or  definitive  character 
respectively.  Suppose  it  should  be  asserted  that  6 
sound  is  the  conflict  between  two  bodies,  the  state- 
ment would  in  my  opinion  be  erroneous.  For  sound 
is  not  the  actual  conflict,  but  a  result  of  the  conflict. 
The  error  is,  however,  of  small  importance  :  for  the 
sense  is  clear,  whatever  the  expression.  But  this 
trivial  mistake  has  given  rise  to  a  very  serious  error 
in  the  minds  of  those  who  have  not  understood  what 
was  meant :  for  on  reading  that  the  essential  basis  was 
the  first  conflict,  they  immediately  concluded  that  the 
basis  was  always  to  be  taken  from  the  first  question, 
which  is  a  grave  mistake.  For  every  question  has  7 
its  basis,  since  every  question  is  based  on  assertion  by 
one  party  and  denial  by  another.  But  there  are  some 
questions  which  form  an  essential  part  of  causes,  and 
it  is  on  these  that  we  have  to  express  an  opinion ; 
while  others  are  introduced  from  without  and  are, 
strictly  speaking,  irrelevant,  although  they  may 
contribute  something  of  a  subsidiary  nature  to  the 
general  contention.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  there 
are  said  to  be  several  questions  in  one  matter  of 
dispute.  Of  these  questions  it  is  often  the  most  8 
trivial  which  occupies  the  first  place.  For  it  is  a 
frequent  artifice  to  drop  those  points  in  which  we 
place  least  confidence,  as  soon  as  we  have  dealt  with 
them  ;  sometimes  we  make  a  free  gift  of  them  to  our

opponents,  while  sometimes  we  are  content  to  use 
them  as  a  step  to  arguments  which  are  of  greater 
importance.  A  simple  cause,  however,  although  it  9 
may  be  defended  in  various  ways,  cannot  have  more 
than  one  point  on  which  a  decision  has  to  be  given, 
and  consequently  the  basis  of  the  cause  will  be  that 
point  which  the  orator  sees  to  be  the  most  important 
for  him  to  make  and  on  which  the  judge  sees  that  he 
must  fix  all  his  attention.  For  it  is  on  this  that  the 
cause  will  stand  or  fall.  On  the  other  hand  questions 
may  have  more  bases  than  one.1  A  brief  example  10 
will  show  what  I  mean.  When  the  accused  says 
"Admitting  that  I  did  it,  I  was  right  to  do  it,"  he 
makes  the  basis  one  of  quality  ;  but  when  he  adds  "  but 
I  did  not  do  it,"  he  introduces  an  element  of 
conjecture.2  But  denial  of  the  facts  is  always  the 
stronger  line  of  defence,  and  therefore  I  conceive  the 
basis  to  reside  in  that  which  I  should  say,  if  I  were 
confined  to  one  single  line  of  argument.  We  are  11 
right  therefore  in  speaking  of  the  first  conflict  of 
causes  in  contradistinction  to  the  conflict  of  questions. 
For  instance  in  the  first  portion  of  his  speech  on 
behalf  of  Rabirius  Postumus  Cicero  contends  that  the 
action  cannot  lie  against  a  Roman  knight,  while  in 
the  second  he  asserts  that  no  money  ever  came  into 
his  client's  hands.  Still  I  should  say  that  the  basis 
was  to  be  found  in  the  latter  as  being  the  stronger  of 
the  two.  Again  in  the  case  of  Milo  I  do  not  consider  12 
that  the  conflict  is  raised  by  the  opening  questions,  but 
only  when  the  orator  devotes  all  his  powers  to  prove  that 
Clodius  lay  in  wait  for  Milo  and  was  therefore  rightly 
killed.  The  point  on  which  above  all  the  orator  must 
make  up  his  mind,  even  although  he  may  be  going  to

take  up  various  lines  of  argument  in  support  of  his 
case,  is  this:  what  is  it  that  he  wishes  most  to  impress 
upon  the  mind  of  the  judge  ?  But  although  this 
should  be  the  first  point  for  his  consideration,  it  does 
not  follow  that  it  should  be  the  first  that  he  will  make 
in  his  actual  speech. 

Others  have  thought  that  the  basis  lay  in  the  first  13 
point  raised  by  the  other  side  in  its  defence.  Cicero  l 
expresses  this  view  in  the  following  words: — "the 
argument  on  which  the  defence  first  takes  its  stand 
with  a  view  to  rebutting  the  charge."  This  involves 
a  further  question  as  to  whether  the  basis  can  only  be 
determined  by  the  defence.  Cornelius  Celsus  is 
strongly  against  this  view,  and  asserts  that  the  basis 
is  derived  not  from  the  denial  of  the  charge,  but  from 

O       * 

him  who  affirms  his  proposition.  Thus  if  the  accused 
denies  that  anyone  has  been  killed,  the  basis  will 
originate  with  the  accuser,  because  it  is  the  latter 
who  desires  to  prove  :  if  on  the  other  hand  the 
accused  asserts  that  the  homicide  was  justifiable,  the 
burden  of  proof  has  been  transferred  and  the  basis 
will  proceed  from  the  accused  and  be  affirmed  by  him. 
I  do  not,  however,  agree.  For  the  contrary  is  nearer  14 
to  the  truth,  that  there  is  no  point  of  dispute  if  the 
defendant  makes  no  reply,  and  that  consequently  the 
basis  originates  with  the  defendant.  But  in  my  15 
opinion  the  origin  of  the  basis  varies  and  depends  on 
the  circumstances  of  the  individual  case.  For  instance 
in  conjectural  causes  the  affirmation  may  be  regarded 
as  determining  the  basis,  since  conjecture  is  employed 
by  the  plaintiff  rather  than  the  defendant,  and  con- 
sequently some  have  styled  the  basis  originated 
by  the  latter  Jiegative.  Again  in  any  syllogism'2 
the  whole  of  the  reasoning  proceeds  from  him  who

affirms.  But  on  the  other  hand  he  who  in  such  cases  l  16 
denies  appears  to  impose  the  burden  of  dealing  with 
such  bases  upon  his  opponent.  For  if  he  says  "  I  did  not 
do  it,"  he  will  force  his  opponent  to  make  use  of  con- 
jecture, and  again,  if  he  says  "  The  law  is  against  you," 
he  will  force  him  to  employ  the  syllogism.  Therefore 
we  must  admit  that  a  basis  can  originate  in  denial. 
All  the  same  we  are  left  with  our  previous  conclusion 
that  the  basis  is  determined  in  some  cases  by  the 
plaintiff,  in  some  by  the  defendant.  Suppose  the  17 
accuser  to  affirm  that  the  accused  is  guilty  of  homi- 
cide :  if  the  accused  denies  the  charge,  it  is  he  who 
will  determine  the  basis.  Or  again,,  if  he  admits  that 
he  has  killed  a  man,  but  states  that  the  victim  was 
an  adulterer  and  justifiably  killed  (and  we  know  that 
the  law  permits  homicide  under  these  circumstances), 
there  is  no  matter  in  dispute,  unless  the  accuser  has 
some  answer  to  make.  Suppose  the  accuser  does 
answer  however  and  deny  that  the  victim  was  guilty 
of  adultery,  it  will  be  the  accuser  that  denies,  and  it 
is  by  him  that  the  basis  is  determined.  The  basis, 
then,  will  originate  in  the  first  denial  of  facts,  but 
that  denial  is  made  by  the  accuser  and  not  the 
accused.  Again  the  same  question  may  make  the  18 
same  person  either  accuser  or  accused.  "  He  who  has 
exercised  the  profession  of  an  actor,  is  under  no  circum- 
stances to  be  allowed  a  seat  in  the  first  fourteen 
rows  of  the  theatre."2  An  individual  who  had  per- 
formed before  the  praetor  in  his  private  gardens,  but 
had  never  been  presented  on  the  public  stage,  has 
taken  his  seat  in  one  of  the  fourteen  rows.  The  19 
accuser  of  course  affirms  that  he  has  exercised  the 
profession  of  an  actor  :  the  accused  denies  that  he  has 
exercised  the  profession.  The  question  then  arises

as  to  the  meaning  of  the  "  exercise  of  the  profession 
of  actor."  If  he  is  accused  under  the  law  regarding 
the  seats  in  the  theatre,  the  denial  will  proceed  from 
the  accused  ;  if  on  the  other  hand  he  is  turned  out 
of  the  theatre  and  demands  compensation  for  assault, 
the  denial  will  be  made  by  the  accuser.  The  view  20 
of  the  majority  of  writers1  on  this  subject  will, 
however,  hold  good  in  most  cases.  Some  have  evaded 
these  problems  by  saying  that  a  basis  is  that  which 
emerges  from  affirmations  and  denials,  such  as  "  You 
did  it,"  "I  did  not  do  it,"  or  "I  was  justified  in 
doing  it."  But  let  us  see  whether  this  is  the  basis  21 
itself  or  rather  that  in  which  the  basis  is  to  be  found. 
Hermagoras  calls  a  basis  that  which  enables  the 
matter  in  question  to  be  understood  and  to  which  the 
proofs  of  the  parties  concerned  will  also  be  directed. 
My  own  opinion  has  always  been  that,  whereas  there 
are  frequently  different  bases  of  questions  in  connexion 
with  a  cause,  the  basis  of  the  cause  itself  is  its  most 
important  point  on  which  the  whole  matter  turns. 
If  anyone  prefers  to  call  that  the  general  question  or 
general  head  of  the  cause,  I  shall  not  quarrel  with  him, 
any  more  than  I  have  done  hitherto  if  he  produced 
a  different  technical  term  to  express  the  same  thing, 
although  I  know  that  whole  volumes  have  been 

^5 

written  on  such  disputes.  I  prefer  however  to  call 
it  the  basis.  There  is  the  greatest  possible  disagree-  22 
ment  among  writers  about  this  as  about  everything 
else,  but  in  this  case  as  elsewhere  they  seem  to  me  to 
have  been  misled  by  a  passion  for  saying  something 
different  from  their  fellow-teachers.  As  a  result 
there  is  still  no  agreement  as  to  the  number  and 
names  of  bases,  nor  as  to  which  are  general  and  which 
special.

To  begin  with  Aristotle  l  lays  down  that  there  are  23 
ten  categories  on  which  every  question  seems  to  turn. 
First  there  is  ovo-i'a,  which  Plautus  calls  essence,  the 
only  available  translation :  under  this  category  we  in- 
quire whether  a  thing  is.  Secondly  there  is  quality, 
the  meaning  of  which  is  self-evident.  Third  comes 
quantity,  which  was  subdivided  by  later  philosophers 
as  dealing  with  two  questions  as  to  magnitude  and 
number.  Next  relation,  involving  questions  of  com- 
petence 2  and  comparison.  This  is  followed  by  when 
and  where.  Then  come  doing,  suffering  and  possessing,  24 
which  for  example  are  concerned  with  a  person's  being 
armed  or  clothed.  Lastly  comes  KCUT&U  or  position, 
which  means  to  be  in  a  certain  position,  such  for  in- 
stance as  being  warm,,  standing  or  angry.  Of  these 
categories  the  first  four  concern  bases,  the  remainder 
concern  only  certain  topics  for  argument.  Others  25 
make  the  number  of  categories  to  be  nine.  Person, 
involving  questions  concerning  the  mind,  body  or 
external  circumstances,  which  clearly  has  reference 
to  the  means  by  which  we  establish  conjecture  or 
quality.  Time,  or  ^povog,  from  which  we  get  questions 
such  as  whether  a  child  is  born  a  slave,  if  his  mother 
is  delivered  of  him  while  assigned3  to  her  creditors. 
Place,  from  which  we  get  such  disputes  as  to  whether 
it  is  permissible  to  kill  a  tyrant  in  a  temple,  or 
whether  one  who  has  hidden  himself  at  home  can  be 
regarded  as  an  exile.  Then  comes  time  in  another  26 
sense,  called  Kcupos  by  the  Greeks,  by  which  they 
refer  to  a  period  of  time,  such  as  summer  or  winter ; 

too  unfamiliar  and  technical  a  term.   "  Competence,"  despite 
its  vagueness,  is  perhaps  the  least  unsatisfactory  rendering.

condition  of  servitude,  being  the  bondsmen  of  their  creditors

under  this  heading  come  problems  such  as  that  about 
the  man  who  held  high  revel  in  a  time  of  pestilence.1 
Action  or  7rpa£i?,  to  which  they  refer  questions  as  to 
whether  an  act  was  committed  wittingly  or  unwit- 
tingly, by  accident  or  under  compulsion  and  the  like. 
Number,  which  falls  under  the  category  of  quantity, 
under  which  come  questions  such  as  whether  the 
state  owes  Thrasybulus  thirty  talents  for  ridding  it  of 
the  same  number  of  tyrants.  Cause,  under  which  27 
heading  come  a  large  number  of  disputes,  whenever 
a  fact  is  not  denied,  but  the  defence  pleads  that  the 
act  was  just  and  reasonable.  TpoTro?  or  manner,  which 
is  involved  when  a  thing  is  said  to  have  been  done  in 
one  way  when  it  might  have  been  done  in  another : 
under  this  category  come  cases  of  such  as  that  of  the 
adulterer  who  is  scourged  with  thongs  or  starved  to 
death.2  Opportunity  for  action,  the  meaning  of  which 
is  too  obvious  to  need  explanation  or  illustration  : 
the  Greeks  however  call  it  Ipywv  d<£op/Aou.  These  28 
authorities  like  Aristotle  hold  that  no  question  can 
arise  which  does  not  come  under  one  of  these  heads. 
Some  subtract  two  of  them,  namely  number  and  op- 
portunity, and  substitute  for  what  I  have  called  action, 
things,  or  in  Greek  Trpay/uara.  I  have  thought  it  suffi- 
cient to  notice  these  doctrines,  for  fear  someone  might 
complain  of  their  omission.  Still  I  do  not  consider 
that  bases  are  sufficiently  determined  by  these  cate- 
gories, nor  that  the  latter  cover  every  possible  kind 
of  topic,  as  will  be  clear  to  any  that  read  carefully 
what  I  have  to  say  on  both  points.  For  there  will  be 
found  to  be  many  topics  that  are  not  covered  by 
these  categories. 

I  find  it  stated  in  many  authors  that  some   rhe-  29 
toricians  only  recognise   one   kind   of  basis,  the  con-

jectural.  But  they  have  not  mentioned  who  these 
rhetoricians  are  nor  have  I  been  able  to  discover. 
They  are  however  stated  to  have  taken  this  view  on 
the  ground  that  all  our  knowledge  is  a  matter  of 
inference  from  indications.  On  this  line  of  reason- 
ing they  might  regard  all  bases  as  qualitative,  because 
we  inquire  into  the  nature  of  the  subject  in  every 
case.  But  the  adoption  of  either  view  leads  to  inex- 
tricable confusion.  Nor  does  it  matter  whether  one  30 
recognises  only  one  kind  of  basis  or  none  at  all,  if 
all  causes  are  of  the  same  nature.  Conieclura  is  de- 
rived from  conicere  "  to  throw  together/'  because  it 
implies  the  concentration  of  the  reason  on  the  truth. 
For  this  reason  interpreters  of  dreams  and  all  other 
phenomena  are  called  coniectores  "conjecturers."  But 
the  conjectural  basis  has  received  more  names  than 
one,  as  will  appear  in  the  sequel. 

Some  have  recognised  only  two  bases.  Arche-  31 
demus  J  for  instance  admits  only  the  conjectural  and 
definitive  and  refuses  to  admit  the  qualitative,  since 
he  held  that  questions  of  quality  take  the  form  of 
"  What  is  unfair?  what  is  unjust?  what  is  disobedi- 
ence?" which  he  terms  questions  about  identity  and 
difference.11  A  different  view  was  held  by  those  who  32 
likewise  only  admitted  two  bases,  but  made  them 
the  negative  and  juridical.  The  negative  basis  is 
identical  with  that  which  we  call  the  conjectural,  to 
which  some  give  the  name  of  negative  absolutely, 
others  only  in  part,  these  latter  holding  that  conjec- 
ture is  employed  by  the  accuser,  denial  only  by  the 
accused.  The  juridical  is  that  known  in  Greek  as  33 
Si/ccuoAoyiKo<?.  But  just  as  Archedemus  would  not 
recognise  the  qualitative  basis,  so  these  reject  the 
definitive  which  they  include  in  the  juridical,  holding

that  in  these  questions  we  have  to  enquire  whether 
it  is  just    that    the    act  with  which  the  accused  is 
charged  should  be  called  sacrilege  or  theft  or  mad- 
ness.    Paxnphilus  held  this   opinion  but  subdivided   34 
quality  into  several  different  species.     The  majority 
of  later  writers  have  classified  bases  as  follows,  in- 
volving however  no  more  than  a  change  of  names  : — 
those    dealing    with     ascertained    facts    and    those 
dealing  with  matters  where  there  is  a  doubt.      For 
a    thing    must    either    be    certain    or    uncertain :    if 
it    is     uncertain,  the    basis    will    be    conjectural;    if 
certain,  it    will    be  some    one    of    the  other    bases. 
Apollodorussays  the  same  thing  when  he  states  that  35 
a  question  must  either  lie  in  things  external,1  which  give 
play  to  conjecture,  or  in  our  own  opinions  :  the  former 
he  calls  Trpay/xariKo?,  the  latter  Trepi  cvi/ot'as.  The  same 
is  said  by  those  who  employ  the  terms  aTrpoA^Tn-os  2 
and  7rpoA.r/7rT(A-o<;,  that  is  to  say  doubtful  and  presump- 
tive, by  this  latter  term  meaning  those  facts  which 
are  beyond  a  doubt.     Theodorus  agrees  with  them,  36 
for  he  holds  that  the  question  is  either  as  to  whether 
such   and  such  a  thing  is  really  so,  or  is  concerned 
with  the  accidents  of  someting  which  is  an  admitted 
fact :  that    is    to    say     it     is    either    Trepi  ovo-t'as    or 
Trepi  o-u/x/?e/5^Korcov.      For  in  all  these  cases  the  first 
basis  is  conjectural,  while  the  second  belongs  to  one 
of  the   other  classes.     As  for  these  other  classes  of 
basis,  Apollodorus  holds  that  there  are  two,  one  con- 
cerned with  quality  and  the  other  with  the  names  of 
things,  that  is  to  say  a   definitive  basis.     Theodorus 
makes  them  four,   concerned  with    existence,  quality, 
quantity  and  relation.     There  are  some  too  who  make  37 
questions   of  identity  and  difference  come   under  the 
head  of  quality,  others  who  place  it  under  the  head

of  definition.  Posidonius l  divides  them  into  two 
classes,  those  concerned  with  words  and  those  con- 
cerned with  things.  In  the  first  case  he  thinks  that 
the  question  is  whether  a  word  has  any  meaning ;  if 
so,  what  is  its  meaning,  how  many  meanings  has  it, 
and  how  does  it  come  to  mean  what  it  means  ?  In 
the  latter  case,  we  employ  conjecture,  which  he  calls 
KO.T'  aivOrjo-iv,  or  inference  from  perception,  quality, 
definition  which  he  calls  KO.-T  IVVQIOV  or  rational  in- 
ference, and  relation.  Hence  also  comes  the  division 
into  things  written  and  unwritten.  Even  Cornelius  38 
Celsus  stated  that  there  were  two  general  bases,  one 
concerned  with  the  question  whether  a  thing  is,  the 
other  with  the  question  of  what  kind  it  is.  He  in- 
cluded definition  under  the  first  of  these,  because 
enquiry  may  equally  be  made  as  to  whether  sacrilege 
has  been  committed,  when  a  man  denies  that  he 
has  stolen  anything  from  a  temple,  and  when  he 
admits  that  he  has  stolen  private  money  from  a 
temple.  He  divides  quality  into  fact  and  the  letter 
of  the  law.  Under  the  head  of  the  letter  of  the  law  he 
places  four  classes,  excluding  questions  of  compe- 
tence'*: quantity  and  intention  he  places  under  the 
head  of  conjecture*  There  is  also  another  method  of  39 
dividing  bases  into  two  classes :  according  to  this 
disputes  are  either  about  substance  or  quality,  while 
quality  is  treated  either  in  its  most  general  sense  or 
in  its  special  senses.  Substance  is  dealt  with  by  con-  40 
jecture :  for  in  enquiring  into  anything,  we  ask 
whether  it  has  been  done,  is  being  done,  or  is  likely 
to  be  done,  and  sometimes  also  consider  itsintention  : 
this  method  is  preferable  to  that  adopted  by  those 
who  style  the  conjectural  basis  a  basis  of  fact,  as 
though  we  only  enquired  into  the  past  and  what  has

actually  been  done.  The  consideration  of  quality  41 
under  its  most  general  aspect  rarely  comes  up  in 
the  courts  ;  I  refer  to  questions  such  as  "  whether 
that  is  honourable  which  is  generally  praised."  With 
regard  to  the  special  aspects  of  quality,  questions 
sometimes  occur  about  some  common  term,  such  as 
whether  sacrilege  has  been  committed  when  a  man 
lias  stolen  private  money  from  a  temple,  or  about 
some  act  with  a  definite  name,  when  there  is  no 
doubt  either  as  to  the  commission  or  the  nature  of 
the  act.  Under  this  heading  come  all  questions 
about  what  is  honourable,  just  or  expedient.  These  42 
bases  are  said  to  contain  others  as  well,  because 
quantity  is  sometimes  concerned  with  conjectural  bases, 
as  in  the  question  whether  the  sun  is  bigger  than 
the  earth,  and  sometimes  with  qualitative  bases,  as  in 
the  question  what  reward  or  punishment  it  would 
be  just  to  assign  to  some  particular  person,  while 
questions  of  competence  undoubtedly  are  concerned 
with  quality,  and  definition  with  questions  of  compe- 
tence.* Further  contradicto^  laws  and  the  ratiocinoiive  43 
basis  or  syllogism*  and  the  majority  of  questions  deal- 
ing with  the  letter  of  the  law  and  intention  are  based 
on  equity,  with  the  exception  that  this  last  question 
sometimes  admits  of  conjecture  as,  for  instance,  con- 
cerning the  intentions  of  the  legislator  :  ambiguity, 
however,  must  always  be  explained  by  conjecture, 
because  as  it  is  clear  that  the  words  admit  of  two 
interpretations  the  only  question  is  as  to  the 
intention. 

A  large  number  of  writers  recognise  general  bases  ;  44 
Cicero    adopts  them  in  his   Orator,3  and  holds  that 
everything  that  can  form  the   subject  of  dispute  or 
discussion  is  covered  by  the  three  questions,  whether

it  is,  n-hat  it  is,  and  of  jvhat  kind  il  is.  The  names 
of  these  three  bases  are  too  obvious  for  mention.1 
The  same  view  is  asserted  by  Patrocles.  Marcus  43 
Antonius  stated  that  there  were  three  bases 
in  the  following  words  : — "The  things  which  form 
the  ground  of  every  speech  are  few  and  are  as 
follows  : — '  Was  a  thing  done  or  not  done  ? '  '  Was  it 
just  or  unjust  ? '  '  Was  it  good  or  bad  ?  '  But  since, 
when  we  are  said  to  have  been  justified  in  doing 
anything,  this  does  not  merely  mean  that  our  action 
was  legal,  but  further  implies  that  it  was  just,  those 
who  follow  Antonius  attempt  to  differentiate  these 
bases  with  greater  exactness.  They  therefore  called 
them  conjectural,  legal  and  juridical,  a  division  which 
meets  with  the  approval  of  Verginius  as  well.  These  46 
they  then  subdivided  into  species,  placing  definition 
under  the  head  of  the  legal  basis,  together  with  all 
others  which  are  concerned  with  the  letter  of  the  law  : 
such  as  that  of  contradictory  larvs,  or  cuTtvoyLua,  that 
which  rests  on  the  letter  of  the  la?v  and  on  meaning 
or  intention  (which  the  Greeks  call  Kara  prjrov  Kal 
Stavotav)  and  /^era/X^i/as  to  which  latter  we  give  various 
names,  styling  it  the  translatiie,  transumptive  or  trans- 
positiie  basis-;  the  syllogis?n,  which  we  call  the 
ratiocinatiie  or  deductive  basis  ;  and  those  which  turn 
on  ambiguity  or  a^L^oXia.  I  mention  these  because 
they  are  called  bases  by  most  writers,  though  some 
prefer  to  call  them  legal  questions. 

Athenaeus  laid  down  that  there  were  four  bases  :  47 

the     TTpOTptTTTlKJl     O"TaCT(5      Or     TTapOpfJLTJTLKlj,      that      is,    tllC 

hortative,  which  is  peculiar  to  deliberative  themes ; 
the  o-uvTtXtKr;,3  which  is  shown  to  be  the  conjectural,  not 
so  much  from  the  name  itself,  but  from  what

follows  ;  the  v7ra\\a.KTtKr)  or  definitive,  for  it  consists 
in  a  change  of  terms  l ;  and  the  juridical  to  which 
he  gives  the  name  employed  by  other  Greek  writers.2 
For,  as  I  have  said,  there  is  a  great  variety  in  the 
names  employed.  There  are  some  who,  arguing  from  48 
its  meaning  of  change,  hold  that  { TroAAaKTt/o;  is  the 
translative  basis,  which  is  concerned  with  competence. 
Others,  Caecilius  3  and  Theon  for  instance,  hold 
that  there  are  the  same  number  of  bases,  but  make 
them  of  a  different  kind,  namely,  those  covered  by 
the  questions  whether  a  thing  is,  what  it  is,  of  what 
kind  it  is  and  how  great  it  is.  Aristotle 4  in  his  49 
Rhetoric  states  that  all  enquiry  turns  on  the  ques- 
tions whether  a  thing  is,  of  what  kind  it  is,  how  great 
it  is,  and  of  how  many  parts  it  consists.  In  one 
place  however  he  recognises  the  force  of  definition 
as  well,  saying  that  certain  points  are  defended 
on  the  following  lines  : — "  I  took  it,  but  did  not 
steal  it."  "I  struck  him,  but  did  not  commit  an 
assault."  Cicero  5  again  in  his  Rhetorica  makes  the  50 
number  of  bases  to  be  four,  namely  those  concerned 
with  fact,  names,  kinds,  and  Legal  action,  that  is  to  say 
conjecture  is  concerned  with  fact,  definition  with 
names,  quality  with  kinds,  and  lam  with  action : 
under  this  latter  head  of  law  he  included  ques- 
tions of  competence.  But  in  another  passage  he 
treats  c  legal  questions  as  a  species  of  action. 

Some  writers  have  held  that  there  arejive  bases  :  51 
the  conjectural,  definitive,  qualitative,  quantitative  and 
relative.  Theodorus,  also,  as  I  have  said,7  adopts  the 
same  number  of  general  heads,  whether  a  thing  is,  what 
it  is,  of  what  kind  it  is,  how  great  it  is,  and  to  what  it  refers. 
The  last  he  considers  to  be  chiefly  concerned  with 
comparison,  since  better  and  worse,  greater  and  less

are  meaningless  terms  unless  referred  to  some 
standard.  But  questions  of  relation,  as  I  have  already  52 
pointed  out,  enter  also  into  translative  questions,  that 
is,  questions  of  competence)  since  in  cases  such  as 
"  Has  this  man  a  right  to  bring  an  action?  "  or  "  Is 
it  fitting  that  he  should  do  such  and  such  a  thing, 
or  against  this  man,  or  at  this  time,  or  in  this 
manner  ?  '  For  all  these  questions  must  be  referred 
to  a  certain  standard.  Others  hold  that  there  are  53 
six  bases  :  conjecture  or  yeVecris,  quality,  particularity  or 
tSiorr/s,  by  which  word  they  mean  definition,  quantity 
or  a£i'a,  comparison  and  competence,  for  which  a  new 
term  has  been  found  in  /xeTatrracris ;  I  call  it  new 
when  applied  to  a  basis,  for  Hermagoras  employs  it 
to  describe  a  species  of  juridical  question.  Others  54 
think  there  are  seven,  while  refusing  to  recognise 
competence,  quantity  or  comparison,  in  place  of  which 
they  substitute  four  legal  bases,1  completing  the 
seven  by  the  addition  of  those  three  which  they  call 
rational?  Others  again  make  eight  by  the  addition  65 
of  competence  to  the  above-mentioned  seven.  Some 
on  the  other  hand  have  introduced  a  fresh  method 
of  division,  reserving  the  name  of  bases  for  the 
rational,  and  giving  the  name  of  questions  to  the  legal, 
as  I  mentioned  above,3  since  in  the  former  the 
problem  is  concerned  with  facts,  in  the  latter  with 
the  letter  of  the  law.  Some  on  the  contrary  reverse 
this  nomenclature  calling  the  legal  questions  bases 
and  the  rational  grounds  questions.  But  others  have  56 
thought  that  there  are  only  three  rational  bases, 
covered  by  the  questions  whether  a  thing  is,  what  it  is, 
and  of  what  kind  it  is  ?  Hermagoras  is  alone  in 
thinking  that  there  are  four,  namely  conjecture,  par- 
ticularity, competence,  and  quality  :  to  the  latter  he

appends  the  phrase  Kara.  a-v/j./StfiyKos,  "  according  to

case  where  it  is  enquired  whether  a  man  happen  to 
be  good  or  bad.  Pie  then  subdivides  qualify  into 
four  species  :  first  that  which  is  concerned  with 
things  to  be  sought  or  avoided,  which  belongs  to  de- 
liberative oratory  :  secondly  those  concerned  nith  57 
persons,  by  which  he  indicates  panegyric  :  thirdly  the 
practical  or  pragmatic,  which  is  concerned  with  things 
in  general  without  reference  to  persons,  and  may  be 
illustrated  by  questions  such  as  whether  he  is  free 
who  is  claimed  as  a  slave  and  waiting  the  trial  of  his 
case/  whether  riches  beget  insolence,  and  whether  a 
thing  is  just  or  good  ;  lastly  there  is  the  juridical 
species,  under  which  practically  the  same  questions 
arise,  but  in  relation  to  certain  definite  persons,  as  for 
instance  when  it  is  asked  whether  that  particular  man 
has  done  well  or  ill.  I  am  aware  that  another  explana-  58 
tion  is  given  by  Cicero  in  the  first  book  of  his 
Rhetorica2  of  the  species  known  as  practical, 
where  he  says  that  it  is  "the  department  under 
which  we  consider  what  is  right  according  to  civil 
usage  and  equity  :  this  department  is  regarded  by 
us  as  the  special  sphere  of  the  lawyer."  But  I  have  59 
already  mentioned3  what  his  opinion  was  about  this 
particular  work.  The  Rhetorica  are  simply  a  collec- 
tion of  school-notes  on  rhetoric  which  he  worked 
up  into  this  treatise  while  quite  a  young  man.  Such 
faults  as  they  possess  are  due  to  his  instructor.  In  the 
present  instance  he  may  have  been  influenced  by  the 
fact  that  the  first  examples  given  by  Hermagoras  of 
this  species  are  drawn  from  legal  questions,  or  by  the 
fact  that  the  Greeks  call  interpreters  of  the  law 

But  for  these  early  efforts  Cicero  substi-  60

tuted  his  splendid  de  Oratore  and  therefore  cannot  be 
blamed  for  giving  false  instruction.  I  will  now 
return  to  Hermagoras.  He  was  the  first  rhetorician 
to  teach  that  there  was  a  basis  concerned  with  com- 
petence, although  the  elements  of  this  doctrine  are 
found  in  Aristotle,1  without  however  any  mention  of 
the  name.  The  legal  questions  were  according  to  61 
Hermagoras  of  five  kinds.  First  the  letter  of  the 
law  and  its  intention  ;  the  names  which  he  gives  to 
these  are  Kara  prjrov  and  U7re£ai'pecrts,  that  is  to  say 
the  letter  of  the  law  and  the  exceptions  thereto :  the 
first  of  these  classes  is  found  in  all  writers,  but  the 
term  exception  is  less  in  use.  The  number  is 
completed  by  the  ratiocinative  basis  and  those 
dealing  with  ambiguity  and  contradictory  laws.  Albutius  62 
adopts  this  classification,  but  eliminates  competence, 
including  it  under  the  juridical  basis.  Further  he 
holds  that  in  legal  questions  there  is  no  ratiocinative 
basis.  I  know  that  those  who  are  prepared  to 
read  ancient  writers  on  rhetoric  more  carefully  than 
I  have,  will  be  able  to  discover  yet  more  on  this 
subject,  but  I  fear  that  I  may  have  been  too  lengthy 
even  in  saying  what  I  have  said. 

I  must  admit  that  I  am  now  inclined  to  take  a  63 
different  view  from  that  which  I  once  held.  It  would 
perhaps  be  safer  for  my  reputation  if  I  were  to  make 
no  modification  in  views  which  I  not  only  held  for  so 
many  years,  but  of  which  I  expressed  my  open  appro- 
bation. But  I  cannot  bear  to  be  thought  guilty  of  64 
concealment  of  the  truth  as  regards  any  portion  of 
my  views,  more  especially  in  a  work  designed  for  the 
profit  of  young  men  of  sound  disposition.  For  Hippo- 
crates,2 the  great  physician,  in  my  opinion  took  the 
most  honourable  course  in  acknowledging  some  of

his  errors  to  prevent  those  who  came  after  from 
being  led  astray,  while  Cicero  had  no  hesitation  about 
condemning  some  of  his  earlier  works  in  books  which 
he  published  later  :  I  refer  to  his  condemnation  of 
his  Lucullus  and  Catulus  l  and  the  books  '2  on  rhetoric 
which  I  have  already  mentioned.  Indeed  we  should  65 
have  no  justification  for  protracting  our  studies  if  we 
were  forbidden  to  improve  upon  our  original  views. 
Still  none  of  my  past  teaching  was  superfluous  :  for 
the  views  which  I  am  now  going  to  produce  will  be 
found  to  be  based  on  the  same  principles,  and  conse- 
quently no  one  need  be  sorry  to  have  attended  my 
lectures,  since  all  that  I  am  now  attempting  to  do  is  to 
collect  and  rearrange  my  original  views  so  that  they 
may  be  somewhat  more  instructive.  But  I  wish  to 
satisfy  everybody  and  not  to  lay  myself  open  to  the 
accusation  that  I  have  allowed  a  long  time  to  elapse 
between  the  formation  and  publication  of  my  views. 
I  used  to  follow  the  majority  of  authorities  in  ad-  66 
hering  to  three  rational  bases,  the  conjectural,  qualita- 
tive and  definitive,  and  to  one  legal  basis.3  These  were 
my  general  bases.  The  legal  basis  I  divided  into  five 
species,  dealing  with  the  letter  of  the  law  and  intention, 
contradictory  laws,  the  syllogism,  ambiguity  and  compe- 
tence. It  is  now  clear  to  me  that  the  fourth  of  the  67 
general  bases  may  be  removed,  since  the  original 
division  which  I  made  into  rational  and  legal  bases  is 
sufficient.  The  fourth  therefore  will  not  be  a  basis, 
but  a  kind  of  question  ;  if  it  were  not,  it  would  form 
one  of  the  rational  bases.  Further  I  have  removed  68 
competence  from  those  which  I  called  species.  For  I 
often  asserted,  as  all  who  have  attended  my  lectures 
will  remember,  and  even  those  discourses  which 
were  published  against  my  will  4  included  the  state-

ment,   that   the  basis   concerned  with    competence 
hardly  ever  occurs  in  any  dispute  under  such  circum- 
stances that  it  cannot  more  correctly  be  given  some 
other  name,  and  that  consequently  some  rhetoricians 
exclude  it  from  their  list  of  bases.     I  am,  however,  69 
well  aware  that  the  point  of  competence  is  raised  in 
many  cases,  since  in  practically  every  case  in  which 
a  party  is  said  to  have  been  ruled  out  of  court  through 
some  error  of  form,  questions  such  as  the  following 
arise  :  whether  it  was  lawful  for  this  person  to  bring 
an    action,  or    to    bring  it    against    some   particular 
person,  or  under  a  given  law,  or  in  such  a  court,  or 
at  such  a  time,  and  so  on.      But  the  question  of  com-  70 
petence  as  regards  persons,  times,  legal  actions  and 
the    rest    originates    in    some    pre-existent    cause  : 
the    question    turns    therefore    not    on    competence 
itself,  but  on    the   cause  with  which   the    point    of 
competence  originates.     "  You  ought  to  demand  the 
return  of  a  deposit  not  before  the  praetor  but  before 
the  consuls,  as  the  sum  is  too  large  to  come  under 
the  praetor's  jurisdiction."    The  question  then  arises 
whether  the  sum  is  too  large,  and  the  dispute  is  one 
of  fact.  "  You  have  no  right  to  bring  an  action  against  71 
me,  as  it  is  impossible  for  you  to  have  been  appointed 
to  represent  the  actual  plaintiff."     It  then  has  to  be 
decided  whether  he  could  have  been  so  appointed. 
"  You  ought  not  to  have  proceeded  by  interdict,1  but 
to  have  put  in  a  plea  for  possession."     The    point 
in  doubt  is  whether  the  interdict  is  legal.    All  these 
points  fall  under  the  head  of  legal  questions.     For  do  72 
not  even  those  special  pleas,  in  which  questions  of 
competence  make  themselves  most  evident,  give  rise  to 
the  same  species   of    question  as  those   laws  under 
which  the  action  is  brought,   so  that  the   enquiry  is

really  concerned  with  the  name  of  a  given  act,1  with 
the  letter  of  the  law  and  its  meaning,  or  with  some- 
thing that  requires  to  be  settled  by  argument  ?  The 
basis  originates  from  the  question,  and  in  cases  of 
competence  it  is  not  the  question  concerning  which 
the  advocate  argues  that  is  involved,  but  the  question 
on  account  of  which  lie  argues.2  An  examplewill  make  73 
this  clearer.  "  You  have  killed  a  man."  "  I  did  not  kill 
him."  The  question  is  whether  he  has  killed  him  ; 
the  basis  is  the  conjectural.  But  the  following  case  is 
very  different.  "  I  have  the  right  to  bring  this  action." 
"  You  have  not  the  right."  The  question  is  whether  he 
has  the  right,and  it  is  from  this  thatwe  derive  the  basis. 
For  whether  he  is  allowed  the  right  or  not  depends 
on  the  event,  not  on  the  cause  itself,  and  on  the  de- 
cision of  the  judge,  not  on  that  on  account  of  which 
he  gives  such  a  decision.  The  following  is  a  similar  74 
example.  "  You  ought  to  be  punished."  "  I  ought 
not."  The  judge  will  decide  whether  he  should  be 
punished,  but  it  is  not  with  this  that  the  question  or 
the  basis  is  concerned.  Where  then  does  the  question 
lie  ?  "  You  ought  to  be  punished,  for  you  have  killed 
a  man."  "1  did  not  kill  him."  The  question  is 
whether  he  killed  him.  "  I  ought  to  receive  some 
honour."  "You  ought  not."  Does  this  involve  a 
basis  ?  I  think  not.  "  I  ought  to  receive  some  honour 
for  killino-  a  tyrant."  "You  did  not  kill  him.'  Here 

o  » 

there  is  a  question  and  a  basis3  as  well.  So,  too,  "  You  75 
are  not  entitled  to  bring  this  action,"  "I  have,"  in- 
volves no  basis.  Where  then  is  it  to  be  found  ?  "  You 
have  no  right  to  bring  this  action,  because  you  have 
been  deprived  of  civil  rights."  In  this  case  the 
question  is  whether  he  has  been  so  deprived,  or 
whether  loss  of  civil  rights  debars  a  person  from

bringing  an  action.  Here  on  the  other  hand  we  find 
both  questions  and  bases.1  It  is  therefore  to  kinds  of 
causes,  not  to  bases  that  the  term  competence  applies  : 
other  kinds  of  cause  are  the  comparative  and  the  recri- 
minatory.^ "But/'  it  is  urged,  "the  case  '  I  have  a  70 
right/  '  You  have  not/  is  similar  to  '  You  have  killed 
a  man/  '  I  was  justified  in  so  doing.'  I  do  not  deny 
it,  but  this  does  not  make  it  a  basis.  For  these  state- 
ments are  not  propositions  until  the  reasons  for  them 
are  added.  If  they  were  propositions  as  they  stand, 
the  case  could  not  proceed.  "  Horatius  has  committed 
a  crime,  for  he  has  killed  his  sister."  "  He  has  not 
committed  a  crime,  since  it  was  his  duty  to  kill  her 
for  mourning  the  death  of  an  enemy."  The  question 
is  whether  this  was  a  justifiable  reason,  and  the  basis 
is  one  of  quality.  So  too  as  regards  competence.  "You  77 
have  no  right  to  disinherit,  since  a  person  who  has 
been  deprived  of  civil  rights  is  not  allowed  to  take 
legal  action."  3  "I  have  the  right,  since  disinheriting 
is  not  legal  action."  The  question  here  is  what  is  legal 
action.  And  we  shall  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  the 
son's  disinheritance  is  unlawful,  by  use  of  the  syllogism.* 
The  case  will  be  similar  with  all  the  rational  and  legal 
bases.  I  am  aware  that  there  have  been  some  who  78 
placed  competence  among  rational  bases,  using  as 
illustrations  cases  such  as,  "I  killed  a  man  under 
orders  from  my  general,"  "  I  gave  the  votive  offerings 
in  a  temple  to  a  tyrant  under  compulsion,"  "  I  de- 
serted owing  to  the  fact  that  storms  or  floods  or  ill- 
health  prevented  me  from  rejoining."  That  is  to  say 
it  was  not  due  to  me,  but  some  external  cause.  From  79 
these  writers  I  differ  even  more  widely :  for  it  is  not 

•/ 

the  nature  of  the  legal  action  itself  which  is  involved 
in  the  question  of  competence^  but  the  cause  of  the  act ;

defensione.  Delude  is,  qui  tali  utitur  patrocinio, 
non  recedit  a  forma  qualitatis,  dicit  enim,  se  culpa 
vacare  ;  ut  magis  qualitatis  duplex  ratio  facienda  sit, 
altera  qua  et  factum  defenditur,  altera  qua  tantum 
reus. 

80  Credendum    est  igitur    his,  quorum   auctoritatem 
secutus  est  Cicero,  tria  esse,  quae  in  omni  disputa- 
tione   quaerantur,  an  sit,   quid  sit,  quale  sit?   quod 
ipsa  nobis  etiam  natura   praescribit.      Nam  primum 
oportet   subesse    aliquid,   de   quo    ambigitur ;    quod, 
quid  sit  et  quale  sit,  certe  non  potest  aestimari,  nisi 
prius    esse    constiterit,   ideoque    ea    prima   quaestio. 

81  Sed  non   statim,  quod    esse   manifestum   est,   etiam 
quid  sit,  apparet.      Hoc  quoque  constitute  novissima 
qualitas  superest,  neque  his  exploratis  aliud  est  ultra. 
His    infinitae    quaestiones,   his    finitae    continentur; 
horum  aliqua  in  demonstrativa,  deliberativa,  iudiciali 

82  materia    utique    tractatur.      Haec    rursus    iudiciales 
causas  et  rationali  parte  et  legali  continent ;  neque 
enim   ulla  iuris  disceptatio    nisi    finitione,   qualitate, 

83  coniectura  potest  explicari.     Sed  instituentibus  rudes 
non   erit  inutilis  latius   primo  fusa   ratio   et,  si  non

and  this  is  the  case  in  almost  every  defence.  Finally 
he  who  adopts  this  line  of  defence,  does  not  thereby 
abandon  the  qualitative  basis  ;  for  he  states  that  he  him- 
self is  free  from  blame,  so  that  we  really  should 
differentiate  between  two  kinds  of  quality,1  one  of 
which  comes  into  play  when  both  the  accused  person 
and  his  act  are  defended,  and  the  other  when  the 
accused  person  alone  is  defended. 

We  must  therefore  accept  the  view  of  the  author!-  80 
ties  followed  by  Cicero/2  to  the  effect  that  there  are 
three  things  on  which  enquiry  is  made  in  every  case  : 
we  ask  whether  a  thing  is,  what  it  is,  and  of  what  kind  it 
is.  Nature  herself  imposes  this  upon  us.  For  first  of  all 
there  must  be  some  subject  for  the  question,  since  we 
cannot  possibly  determine  what  a  thing  is,  or  of  what 
kind  it  is,  until  we  have  first  ascertained  whether  it  is, 
and  therefore  the  first  question  raised  is  whether  it  is. 
But  even  when  it  is  clear  that  a  thing  is,  it  is  not  81 
immediately  obvious  what  it  is.  And  when  we  have 
decided  what  it  is,  there  remains  the  question  of  its 
quality.  These  three  points  once  ascertained,  there 
is  no  further  question  to  ask.  These  heads  cover  both 
definite  and  indefinite  questions.  One  or  more  of  them 
is  discussed  in  every  demonstrative,  deliberative  or 
forensic  theme.  These  heads  again  cover  all  cases  in  82 
the  courts,  whether  we  regard  them  from  the  point 
of  view  of  rational  or  legal  questions.  For  no  legal 
problem  can  be  settled  save  by  the  aid  of  definition, 
quality  and  conjecture.  Those,  however,  who  are  83 
engaged  in  instructing  the  ignorant  will  find  it  useful 
at  first  to  adopt  a  slightly  less  rigid  method  :  the  road 
will  not  be  absolutely  straight  to  begin  with,  but  it 
will  be  more  open  and  will  provide  easier  going.  I 
would  have  them  therefore  learn  above  all  things

that  there  are  four  different  methods  which  may  be 
employed  in  every  case,  and  lie  who  is  going  to  plead 
should  study  them  as  first  essentials.  For,  to  begin 
with  the  defendant,  far  the  strongest  method  of  self- 
defence  is,  if  possible,  to  deny  the  charge.  The 
second  best  is  when  it  is  possible  to  reply  that  the 
particular  act  with  which  you  are  charged  was  never 
committed.  The  third  and  most  honourable  is  to 
maintain  that  the  act  was  justifiable.  If  none  of 
these  lines  of  defence  are  feasible,  there  remains  the 
last  and  only  hope  of  safety  :  if  it  is  impossible  either 
to  deny  the  charge  or  justify  the  act,  we  must  evade 
the  charge  with  the  aid  of  some  point  of  law,  making 
it  appear  that  the  action  has  been  brought  against  us 
illegally.  Hence  arise  those  questions  of  legal  action  84 
or  competence.  For  there  are  some  things,  which, 
although  not  laudable  in  themselves,  are  yet  permit- 
ted by  law  ;  witness  the  passage  in  the  Twelve  Tables 
authorising  creditors  to  divide  up  a  debtor's  body 
amongst  themselves,  a  law  which  is  repudiated  by 
public  custom.  There  are  also  certain  things  which 
although  equitable  are  prohibited  by  law  ;  witness  the 
restrictions  placed  on  testamentary  disposition.1  The  85 
accuser  likewise  has  four  things  which  he  must  keep 
in  mind  :  he  must  prove  that  something  was  done, 
that  a  particular  act  was  done,  that  it  was  wrongly 
done,  and  that  he  brings  his  charge  according  to  law. 
Thus  every  cause  will  turn  on  the  same  sorts  of 
questions,  though  the  parts  of  plaintiff  and  defendant 
will  sometimes  be  interchanged  :  for  instance  in  the 
case  of  a  claim  for  a  reward,  it  will  be  the  plaintiffs 
task  to  show  that  what  was  done  was  right. 

These  four  schemes  or  forms  of  action  which  I  then  86 
called  general  bases  fall  into  two  classes  as  I  have

shown,1  namely,  the  rational  and  the  legal.  The 
rational  is  the  simpler,  as  it  involves  nothing  more 
than  the  consideration  of  the  nature  of  things.  In 
this  connection,  therefore,  a  mere  mention  of  conjec- 
ture, definition  and  quality  will  suffice.  Legal  questions  87 
necessarily  have  a  larger  number  of  species,  since 
there  are  many  laws  and  a  variety  of  forms.  In  the 
case  of  one  law  we  rely  on  the  letter,  in  others  on  the 
spirit.  Some  laws  we  force  to  serve  our  turn,  when 
we  can  find  no  law  to  support  our  case,  others  we 
compare  with  one  another,  and  on  others  we  put  some 
novel  interpretation.  Thus  from  these  three  bases  we  88 
get  three  resemblances  of  bases:  sometimes  simple, 
sometimes  complex,  but  all  having  a  character  of  their 
own,  as,  for  instance,  when  questions  of  the  letter  of 
i he  law  and  its  intention  are  involved,  for  these  clearly 
come  under  conjecture  or  quality ;  or  again  where  the 
syllogism  is  involved,  for  this  is  specially  connected 
with  quality  ;  or  where  contradictory  laws  are  involved, 
for  these  are  on  the  same  footing  as  the  letter  of  the 
law  and  intention  ;  or  yet  again  in  cases  of  ambiguity, 
which  is  always  resolved  by  conjecture  Definition  also  89 
belongs  to  both  classes  of  question,  namely  those 
concerned  with  the  consideration  of  facts  and  those 
concerned  with  the  letter  of  the  law.  All  these 
questions,  although  they  come  under  the  three  bases, 
yet  since,  as  I  have  mentioned,2  they  have  certain 
characteristic  features  of  their  own,  require  to  be 
pointed  out  to  learners  ;  and  we  must  allow  them 
to  be  called  legal  bases  or  questions  or  minor  heads,  as 
long  as  it  is  clearly  understood  that  none  of  them 
involve  any  other  questions  than  the  three  I  have 
mentioned.3  As  regards  questions  of  quantity,  number,  90 
relation,  and,  as  some  have  thought,  comparison,  the

case  is  different.  For  these  have  no  connexion  with 
the  complexities  of  the  law,  but  are  concerned  with 
reason  only.  Consequently  they  must  always  be 
regarded  as  coming  under  conjecture  or  quality,  as,  for 
instance,  when  we  ask  with  what  purpose,  or  at  what 
time,  or  place  something  was  done. 

But  I  will  speak  of  individual  questions  when  I  91 
come  to  handle  the  rules  for  division.1  This  much  is 
agreed  to  by  all  writers,  that  one  cause  possesses  one 
basis,  but  that  as  regards  secondary  questions  related 
to  the  main  issue  of  the  trial,  there  may  frequently 
be  a  number  in  one  single  cause.  I  also  think  there  92 
is  at  times  some  doubt  as  to  which  basis  should  be 
adopted,  when  many  different  lines  of  defence  are 
brought  to  meet  a  single  charge  ;  and,  just  as  in  re- 
gard to  the  complexion  to  be  given  to  the  statement 
of  the  facts  of  the  case,  that  complexion  is  said  to  be 
the  best  which  the  speaker  can  best  maintain,  so  in 
the  present  connexion  I  may  say  that  the  best  basis 
to  choose  is  that  which  will  permit  the  orator  to  de- 
velop a  maximum  of  force.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  93 
we  find  Cicero  and  Brutus  taking  up  different  lines 
in  defence  of  Milo.  Cicero  says  that  Clodius  was 
justifiably  killed  because  he  sought  to  waylay  Milo, 
but  that  Milo  had  not  designed  to  kill  him  ;  while 
Brutus,  who  wrote  his  speech  merely  as  a  rhetorical 
exercise,  also  exults  that  Milo  has  killed  a  bad  citizen. 
In  complicated  causes,  however,two  or  three  bases  may  94 
be  found,  or  different  bases :  for  instance  a  man  may 
plead  that  he  did  not  do  one  thing,  and  that  he  was 
justified  in  doing  another,  or  to  take  another  similar 
class  of  case,  a  man  may  deny  two  of  the  charges. 
The  same  thing  occurs  when  there  is  a  question  95 
about  some  one  thing  which  is  claimed  by  a  number

of  persons,  who  may  all  of  them  rely  on  the  same 
kind  of  plea  (for  instance,  on  the  right  of  the  next  of 
kin),  or  may  put  in  different  claims,  one  urging  that 
the  property  was  left  him  by  will,  another  that  he  is 
next  of  kin.  Now  whenever  a  different  defence  has 
to  be  made  against  different  claimants,  there  must  be 
different  bases,  as  for  example  the  well-known  con- 
troversial theme  :  "  Wills  that  are  made  in  accordance  96 
with  law  shall  be  valid.  When  parents  die  intestate, 
their  children  shall  be  the  heirs.  A  disinherited  son 
shall  receive  none  of  his  father's  property.  A  bastard, 
if  born  before  a  legitimate  son,  shall  be  treated  as 
legitimate,  but  if  born  after  a  legitimate  son  shall  be 
treated  merely  as  a  citizen.  It  shall  be  lawful  to  give 
a  son  in  adoption.  Every  son  given  in  adoption  shall 
have  the  right  to  re-enter  his  own  family  if  his  natural 
father  has  died  childless.  A  father  of  two  legitimate  97 

o 

sons  gave  one  in  adoption,  disinherited  the  other, 
and  acknowledged  a  bastard,  who  was  born  to  him 
later.  Finally  after  making  the  disinherited  son  his 
heir  he  died.  All  three  sons  lay  claim  to  the 
property."  Nothus  is  the  Greek  word  for  a  bastard  ; 
Latin,  as  Cato  emphasized  in  one  of  his  speeches,  has 
no  word  of  its  own  and  therefore  borrows  the  foreign 
term.  But  I  am  straying  from  the  point.  The  son  98 
who  w^as  made  heir  by  the  will  finds  his  way  barred 
by  the  law  "  A  disinherited  son  shall  receive  none  of 
his  father's  property."  The  basis  is  one  resting  on 
the  letter  of  the  law  and  intention,  and  the  problem  is 
whether  he  can  inherit  bv  any  means  at  all  ?  can  he 

•/  •/ 

do  so  in  accordance  with  the  intention  of  his  father? 
or  in  virtue  of  the  fact  that  he  was  made  heir  by  the 
will  ?  The  problem  confronting  the  bastard  is  two- 
fold, since  he  was  born  after  the  two  legitimate  sons

and  was  not  born  before  a  legitimate  son.      The  first    99 
problem  involves  a  syllogism  :    are  those  sons  \vho 
have   been  cast  out  from  their  own  family  to  be  re- 
garded as  though  they  had  never  been   born  ?     The 
second  is  concerned  with  the  letter  of  the  law  and 
intention.     For  it  is  admitted  that  he  was  not  born 
before  any  legitimate  son,  but  he  will  defend    his 
claim  by  appealing  to  the  intention  of  the  law,  which 
he  will  maintain  to  imply  that  the  bastard,  born  when 
there  was  no  legitimate  son  in  the  family,  should 
rank  as  legitimate.     He  will  dismiss  the  letter  of  the  100 
law,  pointing  out  that  in  any  case  the  position  of  a 
bastard  is  not  prejudiced  by  the  fact  that  no  legitimate 
son  was  born  after  him,  and  arguing  as  follows  :— 
"  Suppose  that  the  only  son  is  a  bastard,  what  will 
his  position  be  ?    Merely  that  of  a   citizen  ?  and  yet 
he    was    not    born    after    any    legitimate    son.     Or 
will   he  rank    as    a    son    in    all    respects  ?     But    he 
was   not  born  before  the  legitimate  sons.     As  it  is 
impossible   to   stand   by  the   letter  of  the   law  we 
must  stand  by  its  intentions."     It  need  disturb  no  one  101 
that  one  law  should  originate  two  bases.     The  law  is 
twofold,  and  therefore  has  the   force  of  two  laws.1 
To  the  son  who  desires  to  re-enter  the  family,  the 
disinherited's  first   reply  is,    "Even  though  you  are 
allowed  to  re-enter  the  family,   I   am  still  the  heir." 
The  basis  will  be  the  same  as  in  the  claim  put  forward 
by  the  disinherited  son,  since  the  question  at  issue  is 
whether  a  disinherited  son   can  inherit.     Both  the  102 
disinherited  and  the  bastard  will  object,  "  You  cannot 
re-enter  the  family,  for  our  father  did  not  die  child- 
less."     But    in   this    connexion    each    will    rely    on 
his  own  particular  question.    For  the  disinherited  son 
will  say  that  even  a  disinherited  man  does  not  cease

not  deprive  him  of  his  position  as  son,  but  only  of  his 
position  as  heir.  Here  the  basis  is  definitive,  as  turning 
on  the  definition  of  a  son.  Again  the  bastard  in  his  103 
turn  will  urge  that  his  father  did  not  die  childless, 
employing  the  same  arguments  that  he  had  used  in 
putting  forward  his  claim  that  lie  ranked  as  a  son  ; 
unless  indeed  he  too  has  recourse  to  definition,  and 
raises  the  question  whether  even  bastards  are  not  sons. 
Thus  in  one  case  we  shall  have  either  two  special 
leoal  bases,  namely  the  letter  of  tlie  law  and  intention, 
with  the  syllogism  and  also  definition,  or  those  three  l 
which  are  really  the  only  bases  strictly  so  called,  con- 
jecture as  regards  the  letter  of  the  law  and  intention, 
quality  in  the  syllogism?  and  definition,  which  needs  no 
explanation. 

Further  every  kind  of  case  will  contain  a  cause,  a  104 
point  for  the  decision  of  the  judge,  and  a  central  argument.3 
For  nothing  can  be  said  which  does  not  contain  a 
reason,  something  to  which  the  decision  of  the  judge 
is  directed,  and  finally  something  which,  more  than 
alight  else,  contains  the  substance  of  the  matter  at 

f3  ' 

issue.  But  as  these  vary  in  different  cases  and  are  as 
a  rule  explained  bv  writers  on  judicial  causes,  I  will 
postpone  them  to  the  appropriate  portion  of  my  work. 
For  the  present  I  shall  follow  the  order  which  I 
prescribed  by  my  division 4  of  causes  into  three  classes.

VII.  I  will  begin  with  the  class  of  causes  which  are 
concerned  with  praise  and  blame.  This  class  appears 
to  have  been  entirely  divorced  by  Aristotle,1  and 
following  him  by  Theophrastus,  from  the  practical 
side  of  oratory  (which  they  call  Trpay/xaruo;)  and  to 
have  been  reserved  solely  for  the  delectation  of 
audiences,  which  indeed  is  shown  to  be  its  peculiar 
function  by  its  name,  which  implies  display.2  Roman  2 
usage  on  the  other  hand  has  given  it  a  place  in  the 
practical  tasks  of  life.  For  funeral  orations  are 
often  imposed  as  a  duty  on  persons  holding  public 
office,  or  entrusted  to  magistrates  by  decree  of  the 
senate.  Again  the  award  of  praise  or  blame  to  a 
witness  may  carry  weight  in  the  courts,  while  it  is 
also  a  recognised  practice  to  produce  persons  to 
praise  the  character  of  the  accused.  Further  the 
published  speeches  of  Cicero  directed  against  his 
rivals  in  the  election  to  the  consulship,3  and 
against  Lucius  Piso,  Clodius  and  Curio,4  are  full  of 
denunciation,  and  were  notwithstanding  delivered  in 
the  senate  as  formal  expressions  of  opinion  in  the 
course  of  debate.  1  do  not  deny  that  some  compo-  3 
sitions  of  this  kind  are  composed  solely  with  a  view 
to  display,  as,  for  instance,  panegyrics  of  gods  and 
heroes  of  the  past,  a  consideration  which  provides 
the  solution  of  a  question  which  I  discussed  a  little 
while  back,5  and  proves  that  those  are  wrong  who 
hold  that  an  orator  will  never  speak  on  a  subject 
unless  it  involves  some  problem.  But  what  problem  4 
is  involved  by  the  praise  of  Jupiter  Capitolinus,  a 
stock  theme  of  the  sacred  Capitoline  contest,6  which 
is  undoubtedly  treated  in  regular  rhetorical  form  ?

However,  just  as  panegyric  applied  to  practical 
matters  requires  proof,  so  too  a  certain  semblance  of 
proof  is  at  times  required  by  speeches  composed 
entirely  for  display.  For  instance,  a  speaker  who  tells  5 
how  Romulus  was  the  son  of  Mars  and  reared  by  the 
she-wolf,  will  offer  as  proofs  of  his  divine  origin  the 
facts  that  when  thrown  into  a  running  stream  he 
escaped  drowning, that  all  his  achievements  were  such 
as  to  make  it  credible  that  he  was  the  offspring  of  the 
god  of  battles,  and  that  his  contemporaries  unques- 
tionably believed  that  he  was  translated  to  heaven. 
Some  arguments  will  even  wear  a  certain  semblance  6 
of  defence  :  for  example,  if  the  orator  is  speaking 
in  praise  of  Hercules,  he  will  find  excuses  for  his 
hero  having  changed  raiment  with  the  Queen  of 
Lydia  and  submitted  to  the  tasks  which  legend  tells 
us  she  imposed  upon  him.  The  proper  function 
however  of  panegyric  is  to  amplify  and  embellish  its 
themes. 

This  form  of  oratory  is  directed  in   the  main   to 
the  praise  of  gods  and  men,  but  may  occasionally  be 
applied  to  the   praise   of  animals  or  even  of  inani- 
mate objects.      In  praising  the  gods  our  first  step   1 
will  be  to  express  our  veneration  of  the  majesty  of 
their  nature  in  general  terms  .  next  we  shall  proceed 
to  praise  the  special  power  of  the  individual  god  and 
the  discoveries  whereby  he  has  benefited  the  human 
race.     For  example,  in  the  case  of  Jupiter,  we  shall   h 
extol  his  power  as  manifested  in  the  governance  of 
all  things,  with  Mars  we  shall  praise  his  power  in  war, 
with   Neptune  his  power  over    the  sea;  as  regards 
inventions  we  shall  celebrate  Minerva's  discovery  of 
the  arts,  Mercury's  discovery  of  letters,  Apollo's  of 
medicine,  Ceres'  of  the  fruits  of  the  earth,  Bacchus'

of  wine.  Next  we  must  record  their  exploits  as 
handed  down  from  antiquity.  Even  gods  may  de- 
rive honour  from  their  descent,  as  for  instance  is 
the  case  with  the  sons  of  Jupiter,  or  from  their 
antiquity,  as  in  the  case  of  the  children  of  Chaos,  or 
from  their  offspring,  as  in  the  case  of  Latona,  the 
mother  of  Apollo  and  Diana.  Some  again  may  be  9 
praised  because  they  were  born  immortal,  others 
because  they  won  immortality  by  their  valour,  a  theme 
which  the  piety  of  our  sovereign  has  made  the  glory 
even  of  these  present  times.1 

There  is  greater  variety  required  in  the  praise  of  10 
men.  In  the  first  place  there  is  a  distinction  to  be 
made  as  regards  time  between  the  period  in  which 
the  objects  of  our  praise  lived  and  the  time  pre- 
ceding their  birth  ;  and  further,  in  the  case  of  the 
dead,  we  must  also  distinguish  the  period  following 
their  death.  With  regard  to  things  preceding  a 
man's  birth,  there  are  his  country,  his  parents  and  his 
ancestors,  a  theme  which  may  be  handled  in  two 
ways.  For  either  it  will  be  creditable  to  the  objects  of 
our  praise  not  to  have  fallen  short  of  the  fair  fame  of 
their  country  and  of  their  sires  or  to  have  ennobled 
a  humble  origin  by  the  glory  of  their  achievements. 
Other  topics  to  be  drawn  from  the  period  preceding  11 
their  birth  will  have  reference  to  omens  or  prophe- 
cies foretelling  their  future  greatness,  such  as  the 
oracle  which  is  said  to  have  foretold  that  the  son  of 
Thetis  would  be  greater  than  his  father.  The  praise  12 
of  the  individual  himself  will  be  based  on  his 
character,  his  physical  endowments  and  external 
circumstances.  Physical  and  accidental  advantages 
provide  a  comparatively  unimportant  theme,  which 
requires  variety  of  treatment.  At  times  for  instance

we  extol  beauty  and   strength  in  honorific  terms,  as 
Homer    does    in    the    case    of   Agamemnon 1    and 
Achilles2  ;    at  times  again  weakness  may  contribute 
largely  to  our  admiration,  as  when  Homer  says3  that 
Tydeus  was    small    of    stature    but  a   good  fighter. 
Fortune  too  may  confer   dignity  as   in   the   case   of  13 
kings  and  princes  (for  they  have   a  fairer   field   for 
the  display  of  their   excellences)  but  on  the  other 
hand  the  glory  of  good  deeds  may  be  enhanced   by 
the    smallness    of    their    resources.       Moreover  the 
praise  awarded  to  external  and  accidental  advantages 
is  given,  not  to  their  possession,  but  to  their  honour- 
able employment.      For  wealth  and  power  and  influ-   14 
ence,  since  they  are  the  sources  of  strength,  are  the 
surest  test  of  character  for  good  or  evil ;  they  make  us 
better  or  they  make  us  wrorse.      Praise  awarded  to  15 
character  is  always  just,  but  may  be  given  in  various 
ways.     It  'has  sometimes  proved  the  more  effective 
course  to  trace  a  man's  life  and  deeds  in  due  chrono- 
logical order,  praising  his  natural  gifts  as  a  child,  then 
his  progress  at  school,  and  finally  the  whole  course  of 
his  life,  including  words  as  well  as  deeds.     At  times 
on  the  other  hand  it  is  well  to  divide  our  praises, 
dealing    separately  with    the    various  virtues,  forti- 
tude, justice,  self-control  and  the   rest  of  them  and 
to  assign  to  each  virtue  the  deeds  performed  under 
its  influence.      We  shall   have    to    decide  which    of  16 
these    two    methods   will  be  the  more  serviceable, 
according    to    the    nature    of   the  subject;    but  we 
must  bear  in  mind  the  fact  that  what  most  pleases 
an  audience  is  the  celebration  of  deeds  which  our 
hero  was  the  first  or  only  man  or  at  any  rate  one  of 
the  very  few  to  perform  :  and  to  these  we  must  add 
any  other  achievements  which    surpassed    hope    or

expectation,  emphasising  what  was  done  for  the  sake 
of  others  rather  than  what  lie  performed  on  his 
own  behalf.  It  is  not  always  possible  to  deal  with  17 
the  time  subsequent  to  our  hero's  death  :  this  is 
due  not  merely  to  the  fact  that  we  sometimes  praise 
him,  while  still  alive,  but  also  that  there  are  but  few 
occasions  when  we  have  a  chance  to  celebrate  the 
award  of  divine  honours,  posthumous  votes  of  thanks, 
or  statues  erected  at  the  public  expense.  Among  18 
such  themes  of  panegyric  I  would  mention  monu- 
ments of  genius  that  have  stood  the  test  of  time. 
For  some  great  men  like  Menander  have  received 
ampler  justice  from  the  verdict  of  posterity  than 
from  that  of  their  own  age.  Children  reflect  glory 
on  their  parents,  cities  on  their  founders,  laws  on 
those  who  made  them,  arts  on  their  inventors  and 
institutions  on  those  that  first  introduced  them  ;  for 
instance  Numa  first  laid  down  rules  for  the  worship 
of  the  gods,  and  Publicola  first  ordered  that  the 
lictors'  rods  should  be  lowered  in  salutation  to  the 
people. 

The  same  method  will  be  applied  to  denunciations  19 
as  well, but  with  a  viewto  opposite  effects.  For  humble 
origin  has  been  a  reproach  to  many,  while  in  some 
cases  distinction  has  merely  served  to  increase  the 
notoriety  and  unpopularity  of  vices.  In  regard  to 
some  persons,  as  in  the  story  of  Paris,  it  has  been 
predicted  that  they  would  be  the  cause  of  destruction 
to  many,  some  like  Thersites  and  Irus  have  been 
despised  for  their  poverty  and  mean  appearance, 
others  have  been  loathed  because  their  natural  ad- 
vantages were  nullified  by  their  vices  :  the  poets  for 
instance  tell  us  that  Nireus ]  was  a  coward  and 
Pleisthenes 2  a  debauchee.  The  mind  too  has  as  20

many  vices  as  virtues,  and  vice  may  be  denounced, 
as  virtue  may  be  praised,  in  two  different  ways. 
Some  have  been  branded  with  infamy  after  death 
like  Maelius,  whose  house  was  levelled  with  the 

ground,  or   Marcus    Manlius,  whose  first   name  was 

* 

banished  from  his  family  for  all  generations  to 
come.  The  vices  of  the  children  bring  hatred  on  21 
their  parents;  founders  of  cities  are  detested  for 
concentrating  a  race  which  is  a  curse  to  others,  as 
for  example  the  founder  of  the  Jewish  super- 
stition ; l  the  laws  of  Gracchus  are  hated,  and  we 
abhor  any  loathsome  example  of  vice  that  has  been 
handed  down  to  posterity,  such  as  the  criminal  form  of 
lust  which  a  Persian  is  said  to  have  been  the  first  to 
practise  on  a  woman  of  Samos.  And  even  in  the  22 
case  of  the  living  the  judgment  of  mankind  serves 
as  a  proof  of  their  character,  and  the  fairness  or 
foulness  of  their  fame  proves  the  orator's  praise  or 
blame  to  be  true. 

Aristotle  2  however  thinks  that  the  place  and  sub-  23 
ject  of  panegyrics  or  denunciations  make  a  very  con- 
siderable difference.  For  much  depends  on  the 
character  of  the  audience  and  the  generally  received 
opinion,  if  they  are  to  believe  that  the  virtues  of 
which  they  approve  are  pre-eminently  characteristic 
of  the  person  praised  and  the  vices  which  they  hate 
of  the  person  denounced.  For  there  can  be 
little  doubt  as  to  the  attitude  of  the  audience, 
if  that  attitude  is  already  determined  prior  to 
the  delivery  of  the  speech.  It  will  be  wise  24 
too  for  him  to  insert  some  words  of  praise  for 
his  audience,  since  this  will  secure  their  good 
will,  and  wherever  it  is  possible  this  should  be  done 
in  such  a  manner  as  to  advance  his  case.  Literature

will  win  less  praise  at  Sparta  than  at  Athens,  endur- 
ance and  courage  more.  Among  some  races  the  life 
of  a  freebooter  is  accounted  honourable,  while  others 
regard  it  as  a  duty  to  respect  the  laws.  Frugality 
might  perhaps  be  unpopular  with  the  Sybarites, 
whilst  luxury  was  regarded  as  a  crime  by  the  an- 
cient Romans.  Similar  differences  of  opinion  are 
found  in  individuals.  A  judge  is  most  favourable  to  25 
the  orator  whose  views  he  thinks  identical  with  his 
own.  Aristotle  also  urges  a  point,  which  at  a  later 
date  Cornelius  Celsus  emphasised  almost  to  excess, 
to  the  effect  that,  since  the  boundary  between  vice 
and  virtue  is  often  ill-defined,  it  is  desirable  to  use 
words  that  swerve  a  little  from  the  actual  truth, 
calling  a  rash  man  brave,  a  prodigal  generous,  a  mean 
man  thrifty;  or  the  process  may,  if  necessary,  be  re- 
versed. But  this  the  ideal  orator,  that  is  to  say  a 
good  man,  will  never  do,  unless  perhaps  he  is  led  to 
do  so  by  consideration  for  the  public  interest. 

Cities  are  praised  after  the  same  fashion  as  men.  26 
The  founder  takes  the  place  of  the  parent,  and  an- 
tiquity carries  great  authority,  as  for  instance  in  the 
case  of  those  whose  inhabitants  are  said  to  be  sprung 
from  the  soil.  The  virtues  and  vices  revealed  by 
their  deeds  are  the  same  as  in  private  individuals. 
The  advantages  arising  from  site  or  fortifications  are 
however  peculiar  to  cities.  Their  citizens  enhance 
their  fame  just  as  children  bring  honour  to  their 
parents. 

Praise     too    may    be   awarded    to    public    works,  27 
in     connexion     with     which     their     magnificence, 
utility,    beauty    and    the    architect    or    artist    must 
be   given  due  consideration.     Temples  for  instance 
will    be    praised   for    their    magnificence,  walls   for

their  utility,  and  both  for  their  beauty  or  the  skill  of 
the  architect.  Places  may  also  be  praised,  witness 
the  praise  of  Sicily  in  Cicero.1  In  such  cases 
\ve  consider  their  beauty  and  utility  :  beauty  calls  for 
notice  in  places  by  the  sea,  in  open  plains  and 
pleasant  situations,  utility  in  healthy  or  fertile 
localities.  Again  praise  in  general  terms  may  be 
awarded  to  noble  sayings  or  deeds.  Finally  things 
of  every  kind  may  be  praised.  Panegyrics  have  28 
been  composed  on  sleep  and  death,  and  physicians 
have  written  eulogies  on  certain  kinds  of  food. 

While  therefore  I  do  not  agree  that  panegyric 
concerns  only  questions  regarding  what  is  honour- 
able, I  do  think  that  it  comes  as  a  rule  under 
the  heading  of  quality,  although  all  three  bases  2  may 
be  involved  in  Panegyric  and  it  was  observed  by 
Cicero3  that  all  were  actually  used  by  Gaius  Caesar 
in  his  denunciation  of  Cato.  But  panegyric  is  akin 
to  deliberative  oratory  inasmuch  as  the  same  things 
are  usually  praised  in  the  former  as  are  advised 
in  the  latter. 

VIII.  I  am  surprised  that  deliberative  oratory  also 
has  been  restricted  by  some  authorities  to  questions 
of  expediency.  If  it  should  be  necessary  to  assign 
one  single  aim  to  deliberative  I  should  prefer 
Cicero's4  view  that  this  kind  of  oratory  is  primarily 
concerned  with  what  is  honourable.  I  do  not  doubt 
that  those  who  maintain  the  opinion  first  mentioned 
adopt  the  lofty  view  that  nothing  can  be  expedient 
which  is  not  good.  That  opinion  is  perfectly  sound  2 
so  long  as  we  are  fortunate  enough  to  have  wise  and 
good  men  for  counsellors.  But  as  we  most  often 
express  our  views  before  an  ignorant  audience,  and 
more  especially  before  popular  assemblies,  of  which

by  pirates.  Philip  ejected  the  pirates.  The  Athenians  asked 
him  to  restore  it  ;  he  replied  that  it  belonged  to  him  and 
that  there  could  be  no  question  of  restoration,  but  if  they 
asked  for  it  as  a  gift  he  promised  to  give  it  them.

the  majority  is  usually  uneducated,  we  must  distin- 
guish between  what  is   honourable  and  what  is  ex- 
pedient and  conform  our  utterances  to  suit  ordinary 
understandings.      For  there   are  many  who   do  not  3 
admit  that  what  they  really  believe  to  be  the  honour- 
able   course    is    sufficiently   advantageous,   and    are 
misled  by  the  prospect  of  advantage  into  approving 
courses  of  the  dishonourable  nature  of  which  there 
can  be  no  question:  witness  the   Numantine  treaty 
and  the  surrender  of  the  Caudine  Forks.1     Nor  does  4 
it  suffice  to  restrict  deliberative  oratory  to  the  basis 
of    quality    which    is  concerned    with    questions     of 
honour  and  expediency.      For  there   is   often  room 
for  conjecture  as  well.     Sometimes   again  definition 
is  necessary  or  legal  problems  require  handling  ;  this 
is  especially  the  case  when  advice  has  to   be  given 
on   private   matters,  where  there   is  some  doubt   of 
the  legality  of  the  course  under  consideration.     Of 
conjecture2    I    shall    speak  more   fully  a  little  later 
on.      Returning    to   dejiniiion   for    the    moment,    we   5 
find     it    in   the   question    raised    by   Demosthenes, 
"  whether  Philip  should  give  or  restore  Halonnesus,"  3 
and  to  that  discussed  by  Cicero  in  the  Philippics  4  as 
to  the  nature  of  a  tumultus.     Again    does    not  the 
question    raised    in    connection   with   the    statue  of 
Servius  Sulpicius  5  as  to  "  whether  statues  should  be 
erected  only  in  honour    of  those  ambassadors   who 
perish  by  the  sword  "  bear  a  strong  resemblance  to 
the  questions  that  are  raised  in  the  law  courts  ?    The   6

advisory  department),  while  it  deliberates  about  the 
future,  also  enquires  about  the  past,  while  its  func- 
tions are  twofold  and  consist  in  advising  and 
dissuading. 

Deliberative  oratory  does  not  always  require  an 
exordium,  such  as  is  necessary  in  forensic  speeches, 
since  he  who  asks  an  orator  for  his  opinion  is  naturally 
well  disposed  to  him.  But  the  commencement,  what- 
ever be  its  nature,  must  have  some  resemblance  to  an 
exordium.  For  we  must  not  begin  abruptly  or  just  at 
the  point  where  the  fancy  takes  us,  since  in  every 
subject  there  is  something  which  naturally  comes  first. 
In  addressing  the  senate  or  the  people  the  same  7 
methods  apply  as  in  the  law  courts,  and  we  must  aim 
as  a  rule  at  acquiring  the  goodwill  of  our  audience. 
This  need  cause  no  surprise,  since  even  in  panegyric 
we  seek  to  win  the  favour  of  our  hearers  when  our 
aim  is  praise  pure  and  simple,  and  not  the  acquisition 
of  any  advantage.  Aristotle,1  it  is  true,  holds,  not  8 
without  reason,  that  in  deliberative  speeches  we  may 
often  begin  with  a  reference  either  to  ourselves  or  to 
our  opponent,  borrowing  this  practice  from  forensic 
oratory,  and  sometimes  producing  the  impression  that 
the  subject  is  of  greater  or  less  importance  than  it 
actually  is.  On  the  other  hand  he  thinks  that  in 
demonstrative  oratory  the  exordium  may  be  treated  with 
the  utmost  freedom,  since  it  is  sometimes  drawn  from  9 
irrelevant  material,  as  for  example  in  Isocrates'  Praise 
of  Helen,2  or  from  something  akin  to  the  subject, 
as  for  instance  in  the  Panegyricus  of  the  same  author, 
when  he  complains  that  more  honour  is  given  to  phy- 
sical than  to  moral  excellence,  or  as  Gorgias  in  his 
speech  delivered  at  the  Olympic  games  praises  the 
founders  of  the  great  national  games.  Sallust  seems

to  have  imitated  these  authors  in  his  Jugurthine  War 
and  in  the  introduction  to  his  Catiline,  which  has  no 
connection  with  his  narrative. 

But  it  is  time  for  me  to  return  to  deliberative  oratory  10 
in  which,  even  when  we  introduce  an  exordium,  we 
must  content  ourselves  with  a  brief  prelude,  which 
may  amount  to  no  more  than  a  mere  heading.  As 
regards  the  statement  of  facts,  this  is  never  required  in 
speeches  on  private  subjects,  at  least  as  regards  the 
subject  on  wrhich  an  opinion  has  to  be  given,  because 
everyone  is  acquainted  with  the  question  at  issue. 
Statements  as  to  external  matters  which  are  relevant  1 1 
to  the  discussion  may  however  frequently  be  intro- 
duced. In  addressing  public  assemblies  it  will  often 
be  necessary  to  set  forth  the  order  of  the  points 
which  have  to  be  treated.  As  regards  appeals  to  the  12 
emotions,  these  are  especially  necessary  in  deliberative 
oratory.  Anger  has  frequently  to  be  excited  or 
assuaged  and  the  minds  of  the  audience  have  to  be 
swayed  to  fear,  ambition,  hatred,  reconciliation.  At 
times  again  it  is  necessary  to  awaken  pity,  whether  it 
is  required,  for  instance,  to  urge  that  relief  should  be 
sent  to  a  besieged  city,  or  we  are  engaged  in  deplor- 
ing the  overthrow  of  an  allied  state.  But  what  really 
carries  greatest  weight  in  deliberative  speeches  is  the 
authority  of  the  speaker.  For  he,  who  would  have  13 
all  men  trust  his  judgment  as  to  what  is  expedient 
and  honourable,  should  both  possess  and  be  re- 
garded as  possessing  genuine  wisdom  and  excellence 
of  character.  In  forensic  speeches  the  orator  may, 
according  to  the  generally  received  opinion,  indulge 
his  passion  to  some  extent.  But  all  will  agree  that 
the  advice  given  by  a  speaker  should  be  in  keeping 
with  his  moral  character.

BOOK    III.   vni.  14-17 

The  majority  of  Greek  writers  have  held  that  this  14 
kind  of  oratory  is  entirely  concerned  with  addressing 
public  assemblies  and  have  restricted  it  to  politics. 
Even  Cicero  l  himself  deals  chiefly  with  this  depart- 
ment. Consequently  those  who  propose  to  offer  advice 
upon  peace,  war,  troops,  public  works  or  revenue  must 
thoroughly  acquaint  themselves  with  two  things,  the 
resources  of  the  state  and  the  character  of  its  people, 
so  that  the  method  employed  in  tendering  their  ad- 
vice may  be  based  at  once  on  political  realities  and 
the  nature  of  their  hearers.  This  type  of  oratory  15 
seems  to  me  to  offer  a  more  varied  field  for  eloquence, 
since  both  those  who  ask  for  advice  and  the  answers 
given  to  them  may  easily  present  the  greatest  diversity. 

Consequently  there  are  three  points  which  must 
be  specially  borne  in  mind  in  advice  or  dissuasion  : 
first  the  nature  of  the  subject  under  discussion, 
secondly  the  nature  of  those  who  are  engaged  in  the 
discussion,  and  thirdly  the  nature  of  the  speaker  who 
offers  them  advice.  As  to  the  subject  under  discussion  16 
its  practicability  is  either  certain  or  uncertain.  In 
the  latter  case  this  will  be  the  chief,  if  not 
the  only  point  for  consideration  ;  for  it  will  often 
happen  that  we  shall  assert  first  that  something 
ought  not  to  be  done,  even  if  it  can  be  done,  and 
secondly,  that  it  cannot  be  done.  Now  when 
the  question  turns  on  such  points  as  to  whether  the 
Isthmus  can  be  cut  through,  the  Pontine  Marshes 
drained,  or  a  harbour  constructed  at  Ostia,  or  whether 
Alexander  is  likely  to  find  land  beyond  the  Ocean,2 
we  make  use  of  conjecture.  But  even  in  connection  17 
with  things  that  are  undoubtedly  feasible,  there  may 
at  times  be  room  for  conjecture,  as  for  instance  in 
questions  such  as  whether  Rome  is  ever  likely  to

arma  deposuerint.  Quaedam  et  fieri  posse  et  futura 
esse  credibile  est,  sed  aut  alio  tempore  aut  alio  loco 
aut  alio  modo. 

18  Ubi  coniecturae  non  erit  locus,  alia  sunt  intuenda. 
Et  primum  aut  propter  ipsam  rem,  de  qua  senten- 
tiae  rogantur,  consultabitur  aut  propter  alias  inter- 
venientes    extrinsecus    causas.       Propter    ipsam    de- 
liberant    Patres     conscripti,    an    stipendium    militi 

19  constituant  ?    Haec  materia  simplex  erit.     Accedunt 
causae  aut  faciendi,  ut  deliberant   patres  conscripti, 
an   Fabios  dedant  Gallis  belluin  minitantibus  ;    aut 
non  faciendi,  ut  deliberat  C.   Caesar,  an  perseveret 
in   Germaniam    ire,  cum   milites   passim  testamenta 

20  facerent.       Hae    suasoriae    duplices    sunt.      Nam    et 
illic  causa  deliberandi  est,  quod   bellum   Galli  mini-

conquer  Carthage,  whether  Hannibal  will  return  to 
Africa  if  Scipio  transports  his  army  thither,  or  whether 
the  Samnites  are  likely  to  keep  faith  if  the  Romans 
lay  down  their  arms.1  There  are  some  things  too 
which  we  may  believe  to  be  both  feasible  and  likely 
to  be  carried  into  effect,  but  at  another  time  or  place 
or  in  another  way. 

When  there  is  no  scope  for  conjecture,  our  atten-  18 
tion  will  be  fixed  on  other  points.  In  the  first  place 
advice  will  be  asked  either  on  account  of  the  actual 
thing  on  which  the  orator  is  required  to  express  his 
views,  or  on  account  of  other  causes  which  affect  it 
from  without.  It  is  on  the  actual  thing  that  the 
senate  for  instance  debates,  when  it  discusses  such 
questions  as  whether  it  is  to  vote  pay  for  the  troops. 
In  this  case  the  material  is  simple.  To  this  however  19 
may  be  added  reasons  for  taking  action  or  the  reverse, 
as  for  example  if  the  senate  should  discuss  whether 
it  should  deliver  the  Fabii  to  the  Gauls  when  the 
latter  threaten  war,2  or  Gaius  Caesar  should  deliberate 
whether  he  should  persist  in  the  invasion  of  Germany, 
when  his  soldiers  on  all  sides  are  making  their  wills.3 
These  deliberative  themes  are  of  a  twofold  nature.  20 
In  the  first  case  the  reason  for  deliberation  is  the 
Gallic  threat  of  war,  but  there  may  still  be  a  further 
question  as  to  whether  even  without  such  threat  of 
war  they  should  surrender  those  who,  contrary  to  the 
law  of  nations,  took  part  in  a  battle  when  they  had 
been  sent  out  as  ambassadors  and  killed  the  king 
with  whom  they  had  received  instructions  to  treat. 
In  the  second  case  Caesar  would  doubtless  never  deli-  21 
berate  on  the  question  at  all,  but  for  the  perturbation 
shown  by  his  soldiers ;  but  there  is  still  room  for 
enquiry  whether  quite  apart  from  this  occurrence  it

tem,   in    quam    homines   graviorum    metu   coguntur,

ita  propter   id   ipsum  non   est   necesse,   quia   perire 
potius  licet.      Denique  non   fecerunt   Saguntini  nee

si  quis  liberos  procreare  volet,  necesse  habet  ducere 
uxorem.     Quis  dubitat?  sed  ei,  qui  pater  vult  fieri, 

25  liqueat  necesse  est  uxorem  esse  ducendam.      Itaque 
mihi  ne  consilium  quidem  videtur,  ubi  necessitas  est, 
non  magis  quam  ubi  constat,  quid  fieri  non  possit.

i  C.  Antonius  was  blockaded  in  an  island  off  the  Dalmatian

one  case,  of  a  raft  carrying  1,000  men  from  Opitergium  in 

490 


BOOK    III.  vin.  21-25 

would  be  wise  to  penetrate  into  Germany.  But  it 
must  be  remembered  that  we  shall  always  speak  first 
on  that  subject  winch  is  capable  of  discussion  quite 
apart  from  the  consequences. 

Some  have  held  that  the  three  main  considerations  22 
in  an  advisory  speech  are  honour,  expediency  and 
necessity.  1  can  find  no  place  for  the  last.  For  how- 
ever great  the  violence  which  may  threaten  us,  it  may 
be  necessary  for  us  to  suffer  something,  but  we  are  not 
compelled  to  do  anything ;  whereas  the  subject  of 
deliberation  is  primarily  whether  we  shall  do  any  thing. 
Or  if  by  necessity  they  mean  that  into  which  we  are  23 
driven  by  fear  of  worse  things,  the  question  will  be  one 
of  expediency.  For  example,  if  a  garrison  is  besieged 
by  overwhelmingly  superior  forces  and,  owing  to  the 
failure  of  food  and  water  supplies,  discusses  surrender 
to  the  enemy,  and  it  is  urged  that  it  is  a  matter  of 

**   * 

necessity,  the  words  "  otherwise  we  shall  perish  "  must 
needs  be  added  :  consequently  there  is  no  necessity 
arising  out  of  the  circumstances  themselves,  for  death 
is  a  possible  alternative.  And  as  a  matter  of  fact  the 
Saguntines1  did  not  surrender,  nor  did  those  who  were 
surrounded  on  the  raft  from  Opitcrgium.2  It  follows  24 
that  in  such  cases  also  the  question  will  be  either  one 
of  expediency  alone  or  of  a  choice  betwreen  expedi- 
ency and  honour.  "  But,"  it  will  be  urged,  "  if  a  man 
would  beget  children,  he  is  under  the  necessity  of 
taking  a  wife."  Certainly.  But  he  who  wishes  to 

O  ^ 

become  a  father  must  needs  be  quite  clear  that  he 
must  take  a  wife.      It  appears  to  me,  therefore,  that  25 
where  necessity  exists,  there  is  no  room  for  delibera- 
tion, any  more  than  where  it  is  clear  that  a  thing  is 

Venetia,  surrender  was  scorned  and  the  men  slew  each  other 
rather  than  yield.  See  Lucan,  iv.  462;  Florus,  ii.  33.

BOOK    III.  vin.  25-29 

not  feasible.  For  deliberation  is  always  concerned 
with  questions  where  some  doubt  exists.  Those 
therefore  are  wiser  who  make  the  third  consideration 
for  deliberative  oratory  to  be  TO  Swarov  or  "possibility" 
as  we  translate  it ;  the  translation  may  seem  clumsy, 
but  it  is  the  only  word  available.  That  all  these  26 
considerations  need  not  necessarily  obtrude  them- 
selves in  every  case  is  too  obvious  to  need  explanation. 
Most  writers,  however,  say  that  there  are  more  than 
three.  But  the  further  considerations  which  they 
would  add  are  really  but  species  of  the  three  general 
considerations  just  mentioned.  For  right,  justice, 
piety,  equity  and  mercy  (for  thus  they  translate  TO 
rjp.(pov],  with  any  other  virtues  that  anyone  may  be 
pleased  to  add,  all  come  under  the  heading  of  that 
which  is  honourable.  On  theother  hand, if  the  question  27 
be  whether  a  thing  is  easy,  great,  pleasant  or  free  from 
danger,  it  comes  under  questions  of  expediency.  Such 
topics  arise  from  some  contradiction  ;  for  example  a 
thing  is  expedient,  but  difficult,  or  trivial,  or  un- 
pleasant, or  dangerous.  Some  however  hold  that  at  28 
timesdeliberationis  concerned  solely  with  thequestion 
whether  a  thing  is  pleasant,  as  for  instance  when  dis- 
cussion arises  as  to  whether  a  theatre  should  be  built  or 
games  instituted.  But  in  my  opinion  you  will  never 
find  any  man  such  a  slave  to  luxury  as  not  to  consider 
anything  but  pleasure  when  he  delivers  an  advisory 
speech.  For  there  must  needs  be  something  on  every  29 
occasion  that  takes  precedence  of  pleasure  :  in  propos- 
ing the  institution  of  public  games  there  is  the  honour 
due  to  the  gods ;  in  proposing  the  erection  of  a 
theatre  the  orator  will  consider  the  advantages  to  be 
derived  from  relaxation  f^om  toil,  and  the  unbecoming 
and  undesirable  struggle  for  places  which  will  arise  if

there  is  no  proper  accommodation  ;  religion,  too,  has 
its  place  in  the  discussion,  for  we  shall  describe  the 
theatre  as  a  kind  of  temple  for  the  solemnization  of  a 
sacred  feast.  Often  again  we  shall  urge  that  honour  30 
must  come  before  expediency ;  as  for  instance  when 
we  advise  the  men  of  Opitergium  not  to  surrender  to 
the  enemy,  even  though  refusal  to  do  so  means 
certain  death.  At  times  on  the  other  hand  we  prefer 
expediency  to  honour,  as  when  we  advise  the  arming 
of  slaves  in  the  Punic  War.1  But  even  in  this  case  we  31 
must  not  openly  admit  that  such  a  course  is  dishon- 
ourable :  we  can  point  out  that  all  men  are  free  by 
nature  and  composed  of  the  same  elements,  while 
the  slaves  in  question  may  perhaps  be  sprung 
from  some  ancient  and  noble  stock ;  and  in  the 
former  case  when  the  danger  is  so  evident, 
we  may  add  other  arguments,  such  as  that  they 
would  perish  even  more  cruelly  if  they  surrendered, 
should  the  enemy  fail  to  keep  faith,  or  Caesar  (a 
more  probable  supposition)  prove  victorious.  But  32 
in  such  a  conflict  of  principles  it  is  usual  to  modify 
the  names  which  we  give  them.  For  expediency  is 
often  ruled  out  by  those  who  assert  not  merely  that 
honour  comes  before  expediency,  but  that  nothing 
can  be  expedient  that  is  not  honourable,  while  others 
say  that  what  we  call  honour  is  vanity,  ambition  and 
folly,  as  contemptible  in  substance  as  it  is  fair  in 
sound.  Nor  is  expediency  compared  merely  with  33 
inexpediency.  At  times  we  have  to  choose  between 
two  advantageous  courses  after  comparison  of  their 
respective  advantages.  The  problem  may  be  still 
more  complicated,  as  for  instance  when  Pompey 
deliberated  whether  to  go  to  Parthia,  Africa  or 
Egypt.2  In  such  a  case  the  enquiry  is  not  which  of

two  courses  is  better  or  worse,  but  which  of  three  or 
more.  On  the  other  hand  in  deliberative  oratory  there  34 
will  never  be  any  doubt  about  circumstances  wholly 
in  our  favour.  For  there  can  clearly  be  no  doubt  about 
points  against  which  there  is  nothing  to  be  said. 
Consequently  as  a  rule  all  deliberative  speeches  are 
based  simply  on  comparison,  and  we  must  consider 
what  we  shall  gain  and  by  what  means,  that  it  may  be 

o  •/  »/ 

possible  to  form  an  estimate  whether  there  is  more 
advantage  in  the  aims  we  pursue  or  greater  disadvan- 
tage in  the  means  we  employ  to  that  end.  A  35 
question  of  expediency  may  also  be  concerned  with 
time  (for  example,  "it  is  expedient,  but  not  now") 
or  with  place  ("  it  is  expedient,  but  not  here  ")  or 
with  particular  persons  ("it  is  expedient,  but  not  for 
us  "  or  "  not  as  against  these  ")  or  with  our  method  of 
action  ("  it  is  expedient,  but  not  thus")  or  with 
degree  ("it  is  expedient,  but  not  to  this  extent  "). 

But  we  have  still  more  often  to  consider  per- 
sonality with  reference  to  what  is  becoming,  and  we 
must  consider  our  own  as  well  as  that  of  those 
before  whom  the  question  is  laid.  Consequently,  30 
though  examples  are  of  the  greatest  value  in 
deliberative  speeches,  because  reference  to  his- 
torical parallels  is  the  quickest  method  of  secur- 
ing assent,  it  matters  a  great  deal  whose  authority 
is  adduced  and  to  whom  it  is  commended.  For 
the  minds  of  those  who  deliberate  on  any  sub- 
ject differ  from  one  another  and  our  audience  may 
be  of  two  kinds.  For  those  who  ask  us  for  ad-  3"? 
vice  are  either  single  individuals  or  a  number,  and 
in  both  cases  the  factors  may  be  different.  For 
when  advice  is  asked  by  a  number  of  persons  it 
makes  a  considerable  difference  whether  they  are

the  senate  or  the  people,  the  citizens  of  Rome  or 
Fidenae,  Greeks  or  barbarians,  and  in  the  case  of 
single  individuals,  whether  we  are  urging  Cato  or

Gains  Marius  to  stand  for  office,  whether  it  is  the 
elder  Scipio  or  Fabius  who  is  deliberating  on  his  plan 
of  campaign.  Further  sex,  rank, and  age,  must  be  38 
taken  into  account,  though  it  is  character  that  will 
make  the  chief  difference.  It  is  an  easy  task  to 
recommend  an  honourable  course  to  honourable 
men,  but  if  we  are  attempting  to  keep  men  of  bad 
character  to  the  paths  of  virtue,  we  must  take  care 
not  to  seem  to  upbraid  a  way  of  life  unlike  our  own. 
The  minds  of  such  an  audience  are  not  to  be  moved  39 
by  discoursing  on  the  nature  of  virtue,  which  they 
ignore,  but  by  praise,  by  appeals  to  popular  opinion, 
and  if  such  vanities  are  of  no  avail,  by  demonstration 

J 

of  the  advantage  that  will  accrue  from  such  a  policy, 
or  more  effectively  perhaps  by  pointing  out  the 
appalling  consequences  that  will  follow  the  opposite 
policy.  For  quite  apart  from  the  fact  that  the  minds  40 
of  unprincipled  men  are  easily  swayed  by  terror,  I 
am  not  sure  that  most  men's  minds  are  not  more 
easily  influenced  by  fear  of  evil  than  by  hope  of 
good,  for  they  find  it  easier  to  understand  what  is 
evil  than  what  is  good.  Sometimes  again  we  urge  41 
good  men  to  adopt  a  somewhat  unseemly  course, 
while  we  advise  men  of  poor  character  to  take  a 
course  in  which  the  object  is  the  advantage  of 
those  who  seek  our  advice.  I  realise  the  thought 
that  will  immediately  occur  to  my  reader  :  "  Do  you 
then  teach  that  this  should  be  done  or  think  it 
right?'  Cicero1  might  clear  me  from  blame  in  the 
matter  ;  for  he  writes  to  Brutus  in  the  following 
terms,  after  setting  forth  a  number  of  things  that

might  honourably  be  urged  on  Caesar  :  "  Should  I  be 
a  good  man  to  advise  this  ?      No.      For  the  end  of  him 
who   gives  advice  is  the  advantage   of  the   man   to 
whom  he  gives  it.      But,  you  say,  your  advice  is  right. 
Certainly,   but  there   is    not  always   room    for  what 
is     right    in    giving    advice."       However,  this    is    a 
somewhat  abstruse    question,  and  does  not  concern 
deliberative  oratory  alone.      I  shall  therefore  reserve 
it  for  my  twelfth  and  concluding  book.1    For  my  part  43 
I  would  not  have  anything  done  dishonourably.     But 
for  the  meantime  let  us  regard  these  questions  as  at 
least  belonging  to    the   rhetorical   exercises   of   the 
schools  :  for  knowledge  of  evil  is  necessary  to  enable 
us  the  better    to    defend    what   is    right.      For  the  44 
present  I  will  only  say  that  if  anyone  is  going  to  urge 
a  dishonourable   course    on   an   honourable  man,  he 
should  remember  not  to  urge  it  as  being  dishonour- 
able, and  should  avoid   the   practice  of  certain  de- 
claimers  who  urge   Sextus   Pompeius   to   piracy  just 
because  it  is  dishonourable  and  cruel.    Even  when  we 
address  bad  men,  we  should  gloss  over  what  is  un- 
sightly.     For  there  is  no  man  so  evil  as  to  wish  to 
seem  so.      Thus  Sallust  makes  Catiline  2  speak  as  one  45 
who  is  driven  to  crime  not  by  wickedness  but  by  in- 
dignation, and  Varius  makes  Atreus  say  : 

"  My  wrongs  are  past  all  speech, 
And  such  shall  be  the  deeds  they  force  me  to." 

How  much  more  has  this  pretence  of  honour  to  be 
kept  up  by  those  who  have  a  real  regard  for  their 
own  good  name  !  Therefore  when  we  advise  Cicero  46 
to  beg  Antonius  for  mercy  or  even  to  burn  the 
Philippics  if  Antonius  promises  to  spare  him  on  that 
condition,3  we  shall  not  emphasise  the  love  of  life  in 
our  advice  (for  if  that  passion  has  any  force  with

opus  est  occasione,  ne  eum   tali um   precum   pudeat. 
Et  C.  Caesari  suadentes  regnum  adfirmabimus  stare 
iam  rempublicam  nisi  uno  regente  non  posse.      Nam 
qui  de   re  nefaria  deliberat,   id   solum  quaerit,  quo- 
modo  quam  minimum  peccare  videatur. 

48  Multum  refert  etiam,  quae  sit  persona  suadentis;

him,  it  will  have  it  none  the  less  if  we  are  silent), 
but  we  shall  exhort  him  to  save  himself  in  the  in- 
terest of  the  state.  For  he  needs  some  such  reason  47 
as  that  to  preserve  him  from,  feeling  shame  at  en- 
treating such  a  one  as  Antony.  Again  if  we  urge 
Gaius  Caesar  l  to  accept  the  crown  we  shall  assert 
that  the  state  is  doomed  to  destruction  unless  con- 
trolled by  a  monarchy.  For  the  sole  aim  of  the  man 
who  is  deliberating  about  committing  a  criminal  act 
is  to  make  his  act  appear  as  little  wicked  as  possible. 

It  also  makes  a  great  deal  of  difference  who  it  is  48 
that  is  offering  the  advice  :  for  if  his  past  has  been 
illustrious,  or  if  his  distinguished  birth  or  age  or 
fortune  excite  high  expectations,  care  must  be  taken 
that  his  words  are  not  unworthy  of  him.  If  on  the 
other  hand  he  has  none  of  these  advantages  he  will 
have  to  adopt  a  humbler  tone.  For  what  is  regarded 
as  liberty  in  some  is  called  licence  in  others.  Some 
receive  sufficient  support  from  their  personal 
authority,  while  others  find  that  the  force  of  reason 
itself  is  scarce  sufficient  to  enable  them  to  maintain 
their  position. 

Consequently  I  regard  impersonation  as  the  most  49 
difficult  of  tasks,  imposed  as  it  is  in  addition  to  the 
other  work  involved  by  a  deliberative  theme.  For 
the  same  speaker  has  on  one  occasion  to  impersonate 
Caesar,  on  another  Cicero  or  Cato.  But  it  is  a  most 
useful  exercise  because  it  demands  a  double  effort 
and  is  also  of  the  greatest  use  to  future  poets  and 
historians,  while  for  orators  of  course  it  is  absolutely 
necessary.  For  there  are  many  speeches  composed  50 
by  Greek  and  Latin  orators  for  others  to  deliver,  the 
words  of  which  had  to  be  adapted  to  suit  the  posi- 
tion and  character  of  those  for  whom  they  were

written.  Do  you  suppose  that  Cicero  thought  in  the 
same  way  or  assumed  the  same  character  when  he 
wrote  for  Gnaeus  Pompeius  and  when  he  wrote  for 
Titus  Ampius  and  the  rest  ? l  Did  he  not  rather  bear 
in  mind  the  fortune,  rank  and  achievements  of  each 
single  individual  and  represent  the  character  of  all 
to  whom  he  gave  a  voice  so  that  though  they  spoke 
better  than  they  could  by  nature,  they  still  might 
seem  to  speak  in  their  own  persons  ?  For  a  speech  51 
which  is  out  of  keeping  with  the  man  who  delivers 
it  is  just  as  faultv  as  the  speech  which  fails  to  suit 
the  subject  to  which  it  should  conform.  It  is  for 
this  reason  that  Lysias  is  regarded  as  having  shown 
the  highest  art  in  the  speeches  which  he  wrote  for 
uneducated  persons,  on  account  of  their  extraordin- 
ary realism.  In  the  case  of  declaimers  indeed  it  is 
of  the  first  importance  that  they  should  consider 
what  best  suits  each  character  :  for  they  rarely  play 
the  role  of  advocates  in  their  declamations.  As  a 
rule  they  impersonate  sons,  parents,  rich  men,  old 
men,  gentle  or  harsh  of  temper,  misers,  superstiti- 
ous persons,  cowards  and  mockers,  so  that  hardly 
even  comic  actors  have  to  assume  more  numerous 
roles  in  their  performances  on  the  stage  than 
these  in  their  declamations.  All  these  roles  may  52 
be  regarded  as  forming  part  of  impersonation, 
which  I  have  included  under  deliberative  themes, 
from  which  it  differs  merely  in  that  it  involves  the 
assumption  of  a  role.  It  is  sometimes  introduced 
even  with  controversial  themes,  which  are  drawn 
from  history  and  involve  the  appearance  of  definite 
historical  characters  as  pleaders.  I  am  aware  also  53 
that  historical  and  poetical  themes  are  often  set  for 
the  sake  of  practice,  such  as  Priam's  speech  to

Achilles  or  Sulla's  address  to  the  people  on  his 
resignation  of  the  dictatorship.  But  these  will  fall 
under  one  or  other  of  the  three  classes  into  which 
I  have  divided  causes.  For  entreaty,  statement,

and  argument,  with  other  themes  already  mentioned, 
are  all  of  frequent  occurrence  in  forensic,  deliberative 
or  demonstrative  subjects,  according  as  circumstances 
demand,  and  we  often  introduce  fictitious  speeches  54 
of  historical  persons,  whom  we  select  ourselves. 
Cicero  for  instance  in  the  pro  Caclio  l  makes  both 
Appius  Caecus  and  her  brother  Clodius  address 
Clodia,  the  former  rebuking  her  for  her  immorality, 
the  latter  exhorting  her  thereto. 

In  scholastic  declamations  the  fictitious  themes  for  55 
deliberative  speeches  are  often  not  unlike  those  of 
controversial  speeches  and  are  a  compromise  between 
the  two  forms,  as  for  instance  when  the  theme  set  is 
a  discussion  in  the  presence  of  Gaius  Caesar  of  the 
punishment  to  be  meted  out  to  Theodotus  ;  for  it  con- 
sists of  accusation  and  defence,  both  of  them  peculiar 
to  forensic  oratory.  But  the  topic  of  expediency  also  56 
enters  into  the  case,  in  such  questions  as  whether  it 
was  to  Caesar's  advantage  that  Pompeius  should  be 
slain ;  whether  the  execution  of  Theodotus  would 
involve  the  risk  of  a  war  with  the  king  of  Egypt; 
whether  such  a  war  would  be  highly  inopportune  at 
such  a  critical  moment,  would  prove  dangerous  and 
be  certain  to  last  a  long  time.  There  is  also  a  question  57 
of  honour.  Does  it  befit  Caesar  to  avenge  Pompeius' 
death  ?  or  is  it  to  be  feared  that  an  admission  that 
Pompeius  did  not  deserve  death  will  injure  the  cause 
of  the  Caesarian  party  ?  It  may  be  noted  that  dis-  58 
cussions  of  such  a  kind  may  well  occur  in  actual 
cases.

Declaimers  have  however  often  been  guilty  of  an 
error  as  regards  deliberative  themes  which  has  in- 
volved a  series  of  consequences.  They  have  con- 
sidered deliberative  themes  to  be  different  and 
absolutely  opposed  to  forensic  themes.  For  they  have 
always  affected  abrupt  openings,  an  impetuous  style 
and  a  generous  embellishment, as  they  call  it,  in  their 
language,  and  have  been  especially  careful  to  make 
shorter  notes  for  deliberative  than  for  forensic  themes. 

»x 

For  my  part  while  I  realise  that  deliberative  themes  69 
do  not  require  an  exordium,  for  reasons  which  I  have 
already  stated,  I  do  not,  however,  understand  why 
they  should  open  in  such  a  wild  and  exclamatory 
manner.  When  a  man  is  asked  to  express  his  opinion 
on  any  subject,  he  does  not,  if  he  is  sane,  begin  to 
shriek,  but  endeavours  as  far  as  possible  to  win  the 
assent  of  the  man  who  is  considering  the  question  by 
a  courteous  and  natural  opening.  Why,  I  ask,  in  60 
view  of  the  fact  that  deliberations  require  moderation 
above  all  else,  should  the  speaker  on  such  themes  in- 
dulge in  a  torrential  style  of  eloquence  kept  at  one 
high  level  of  violence  ?  I  acknowledge  that  in  con- 
troversial speeches  the  tone  is  often  lowered  in  the 
exordium,  the  statement  of  facts  and  the  argument,  and 
that  if  you  subtract  these  three  portions,  the  re- 
mainder is  more  or  less  of  the  deliberative  type  of 
speech,  but  what  remains  must  likewise  be  of  a  more 
even  flow,  avoiding  all  violence  and  fury.  With  61 
regard  to  magnificence  of  language,  deliberative  de- 
claimers  should  avoid  straining  after  it  more  than 
others,  but  it  comes  to  them  more  naturally.  For 
there  is  a  preference  among  those  who  invent  such 
themes  for  selecting  great  personages,  such  as  kings, 
princes,  senators  and  peoples,  while  the  theme  itself

is  generally  on  a  grander  scale.  Consequently  since 
the  words  are  suited  to  the  theme,  they  acquire 
additional  splendour  from  the  magnificence  of  the 
matter.  In  actual  deliberations  the  case  is  different,  62 
and  consequently  Theophrastus  laid  it  down  that  in 
the  deliberative  class  of  oratory  the  language  should 
as  far  as  possible  be  free  from  all  affectation  :  in 
stating  this  view  he  followed  the  authority  of  his  in- 
structor, although  as  a  rule  he  is  not  afraid  to  differ 
from  him.  For  Aristotle  l  held  that  the  demonstrative  63 
type  of  oratory  was  the  best  suited  for  writing  and 
that  the  next  best  was  forensic  oratory  :  his  reason  for 
this  view  was  that  the  first  type  is  entirely  concerned 
with  display,  while  the  second  requires  art,  which 
will  even  be  employed  to  deceive  the  audience,  if 
expedience  should  so  demand,  whereas  advice  requires 
only  truth  and  prudence.  I  agree  with  this  view  as  64 
regards  demonstrative  oratory  (in  fact  all  writers  are 
agreed  on  this  point),  but  as  regards  forensic  and  deli- 
berative themes  I  think  that  the  style  must  be  suited  to 
the  requirements  of  the  subject  which  has  to  be  treated. 
For  I  notice  that  the  Philippics  of  Demosthenes  65 
are  pre-eminent  for  the  same  merits  as  his  forensic 
speeches,  and  that  the  opinions  expressed  by  Cicero 
before  the  senate  or  the  people  are  as  remarkable  for 
the  splendour  of  their  eloquence  as  the  speeches 
which  he  delivered  in  accusing  or  defending  persons 
before  the  courts.  And  yet  Cicero2  says  of  delibera- 
tive oratory  that  the  whole  speech  should  be  simple 
and  dignified,  and  should  derive  its  ornament  rather 
from  the  sentiments  expressed  than  the  actual  words. 
As  regards  the  use  of  examples  practically  all  authori-  66 
ties  are  with  good  reason  agreed  that  there  is  no 
subject  to  which  they  are  better  suited,  since  as  a

rule  history  seems  to  repeat  itself  and  the  experience 
of  the  past  is  a  valuable  support  to  reason.  Brevity  07 
and  copiousness  are  determined  not  so  much  by  the 
nature  as  by  the  compass  of  the  subject.  For,  just  as 
in  deliberations  the  question  is  generally  less  com- 
plicated, so  in  forensic  cases  it  is  often  of  less 
importance. 

Anyone  who  is  content  to  read  not  merelv  speeches, 
but  history  as  well,  in  preference  to  growing  grey  over 
the  notebooks  of  the  rhetoricians,  will  realise  the 
truth  of  what  I  say  :  for  in  the  historians  the  speeches 
delivered  to  the  people  and  the  opinions  expressed 
in  the  senate  often  provide  examples  of  advice  and 
dissuasion.  He  will  find  an  avoidance  of  abrupt  68 
openings  in  deliberative  speeches  and  will  note  that 
the  forensic  style  is  often  the  more  impetuous  of  the 
two,  while  in  both  cases  the  words  are  suited  to  the 
matter  and  forensic  speeches  are  often  shorter  than 
deliberative.  Nor  will  he  find  in  them  those  faults  into  69 
which  some  of  our  declaimers  fall,  namely  a  coarse 
abuse  of  those  who  hold  opposite  opinions  and  a 
general  tendency  to  speak  in  such  a  way  as  to  make 
it  seem  that  the  speaker's  views  are  in  opposition  to 
those  of  the  persons  who  ask  his  advice.  Consequently 
their  aim  seems  to  be  invective  rather  than  persuasion. 
I  would  have  my  younger  readers  realise  that  these  70 
words  are  penned  for  their  special  benefit  that  they 
may  not  desire  to  adopt  a  different  style  in  their 
exercises  from  that  in  which  they  will  be  required  to 
speak,  and  may  not  be  hampered  by  having  to  un- 
learn what  they  have  acquired.  For  the  rest  if  they 
are  ever  summoned  to  take  part  in  the  counsels  of 
their  friends,  or  to  speak  their  opinions  in  the  senate, 
or  advise  the  emperor  on  some  point  on  which  he

IX.  Xunc  de  iudiciali  genere,  quod  est  praecipue 
multiplex,  sed  ofiiciis  constat  duobus  intentionis  ac 
depulsionis.  Cuius  partes,  ut  plurimis  auctoribus 
placuit,  quinque  sunt  :  prooemium,  narralio,  pro- 
batio,  refutatio,  peroratio.  His  adiecerunt  quidam 
partitionem,  propositionem,  exccssum  ;  quarum  pri- 

2  ores    duae    probation!    succedunt.       Nam    proponere 
quidem,    quae    sis    probaturus,   necesse    est,   sed    et 
concludere  ;  cur  igitur  si  ilia  pars  causae  est,  non  et 
liaec    sit?      Partitio   vero    dispositionis    est    species, 
ipsa  dispositio  pars  rhetorices  et  per  oinnes  materias 
tottnnque    earum    corpus    aequaliter    fusa,  sicut    in- 

3  ventio,  elocutio.      Ideoque   earn  non   orationis  totius 
partem  unam   esse  credendum  est  sed  quaestionum 
etiam  singularum.      Quae   est  eniin  (|uaestio,,  in  qua 
non     promittere     possit     orator,     quid     primo,    quid 
secundo,    quid    tertio    sit    loco    dicturus?    quod    est 
proprium    partitionis.       Quam    ergo    ridiculum     est, 
quaestionem   quidem   speciem  esse  probationis,   par-

tatius  esse   coepit,  excessus,  sive   est  extra   causam, 
non  potest  esse  pars  causae,  sive  est  in  causa,  adiu- 
torium  vel  ornamentum  partium  est  earum,  ex  quibus 
egreditur.        Nam    si,    quidquid    in    causa    est,    pars 
causae    vocabitur,   cur   non  argumentum,  similitudo,

may  consult  them,  they  will  learn  from  practice 
what  they  cannot  perhaps  put  to  the  credit  of  the 
schools. 

IX.  I  now  come  to  the  forensic  kind  of  oratory, 
which  presents  the  utmost  variety,  but  whose  duties 
are  no  more  than  two,  the  bringing  and  rebutting 
of  charges.  Most  authorities  divide  the  forensic 
speech  into  five  parts  :  the  exordium,  the  statement  of 
facts,  the  proof,  the  refutation,  and  the  peroration. 
To  these  some  have  added  the  partition  into  heads, 
proposition  and  digression,  the  two  first  of  which 
form  part  of  the  proof.  For  it  is  obviouslv  '2 
necessary  to  propound  what  you  are  going  to  prove 
as  well  as  to  conclude.  Why  then,  if  proposition  is  a 
part  of  a  speech,  should  not  conclusion  be  also  ?  Par- 
tition on  the  other  hand  is  merely  one  aspect  of 
arrangement,  and  arrangement  is  a  part  of  rhetoric 
itself,  and  is  equally  distributed  through  every  theme 
of  oratory  and  their  whole  body,  just  as  are  invention 
and  style.  Consequently  we  must  regard  partition  3 
not  as  one  part  of  a  whole  speech,  but  as  a  part  of 
each  individual  question  that  may  be  involved.  For 
what  question  is  there  in  which  an  orator  cannot 
set  forth  the  order  in  which  he  is  going  to  make 
his  points  ?  And  this  of  course  is  the  function  of  par- 
tition. Bat  how  ridiculous  it  is  to  make  each  ques- 
tion an  aspect  of  proof,  but  partition  which  is  an 
aspect  of  a  question  a  part  of  the  whole  speech.  As  4 
for  digression  (egressio,  now  more  usually  styled 
excessus],  if  it  lie  outside  the  case,  it  cannot  be  part 
of  it,  while,  if  it  lie  within  it.  it  is  merely  an  acces- 
sory or  ornament  of  that  portion  of  the  case  from 
which  digression  is  made.  For  if  anything  that  lies 

* 

within  the  case  is  to  be   called  part  of  it,  why  not

5  Tamen  nee  iis  adsentior,  qui  detraliunt  refutationem 
tanquam  probation!  subiectam,  ut  Aristoteles  ;  haec 
enim  est,  quae  constituat,  ilia,  quae  destruat.      Hoc 
quoque  idem  aliquatenus  novat,  quod  prooemio  non 
narrationem    subiungit   sed    propositionem.       Verum 
id    facit,   quia  propositio   ei    genus,   narratio   species 
videtur,  et  hac  non  semper,  ilia   semper   et  ubique 
credit  opus  esse. 

6  Verum    ex    his    quas    constitui    partibus    non,    ut 
quidque   primum  dicendum,  ita  primum   cogitandum 
est ;  sed   ante  omnia  intueri  oportet,  quod  sit  genus 
causae,    quid    in    ea    quaeratur,    quae    prosint,    quae 
noceant,  deinde  quid  confirmandum  sit  ac  refellen- 

7  dum,  turn   quo   modo   narrandum.      Expositio   enim 
probationum  est  praeparatio,  nee  esse  utilis  potest, 
nisi    priiis    constiterit,    quid    debeat    de    probatione 
promittere.      Postremo    intuendum,    quemadmodum 
index  sit  conciliandus.      Neque  enim  nisi  totius  causae 
partibus  diligenter  inspectis  scire  possumus,  qualem 
nobis  facere  animum  cognoscentis  expediat,  severum 
an  mitem.  concitatum  an  remissum,  adversum  ffratiae

an  obnoxium. 

8  Neque  ideo  tamen  eos  probaverim,  qui  scribendum

BOOK    III.  ix.  4-8 

call  argument,  comparison,  commonplace,  pathos,  illus- 
tration parts  of  the  case?  On  the  other  hand  I  5 
disagree  with  those  who,  like  Aristotle/  would  re- 
move refutation  from  the  list  on  the  ground  that  it 
forms  part  of  the  proof :  for  the  proof  is  construc- 
tive, and  the  refutation  destructive.  Aristotle  2  also 
introduces  another  slight  novelty  in  making  proposi- 
tion, not  statement  of  facts,  follow  the  exordium.  This 
however  he  does  because  lie  regards  proposition  as 
the  genus  and  statement  of  j  acts  as  the  species,  with 
the  result  that  he  holds  that,  whereas  the  former  is 
always  and  everywhere  necessary,  the  latter  may 
sometimes  be  dispensed  with. 

It  is  however  necessary  to  point  out  as  regards  6 
these  five  parts  which  I  have  established,,  that  that 
which  has  to  be  spoken  first  is  not  necessarily  that 
which  requires  our  first  consideration.  But  above 
all  we  must  consider  the  nature  of  the  case, 
the  question  at  issue  and  the  arguments  for  and 
against.  Next  we  must  consider  what  points  are 
to  be  made,  and  what  refuted,  and  then  how  the 
facts  are  to  be  stated.  For  the  statement  of  facts  is  7 
designed  to  prepare  the  way  for  the  proof's  and  must 
needs  be  unprofitable,  unless  we  have  first  deter- 
mined what  proofs  are  to  be  promised  in  the  state- 
ment. Finally  we  must  consider  how  best  to  win  the 
judge  to  take  our  view.  For  we  cannot  be  sure  until 
we  have  subjected  all  the  parts  of  the  case  to  careful 
scrutiny,  what  sort  of  impression  we  wish  to  make 
upon  the  judge  :  are  we  to  mollify  him  or  increase 
his  severity,  to  excite  or  relax  his  interest  in  the 
case,  to  render  him  susceptible  to  influence  or  the 
reverse  ? 

I  cannot  however  approve  the  view  of  those  who  8

think  that  the  exordium  should  actually  be  written  last. 
For  though  we  must  collect  all  our  material  and  deter- 
mine the  proper  place  for  each  portion  of  it,  before 
we  begin  to  speak  or  write,  we  must  commence  with 
what  naturally  comes  first.  No  one  begins  a  portrait  9 
by  painting  or  modelling  the  feet.,  and  no  art  finds  its 
completion  at  the  point  where  it  should  begin. 
Otherwise  what  will  happen  if  we  have  not  time  to 
write  our  speecli  ?  Will  not  the  result  of  such  a 
reversal  of  tiie  proper  order  of  things  be  that  we 
shall  be  caught  napping  ?  We  must  therefore  re- 
view the  subject-matter  in  the  order  laid  down,  but 
write  our  speech  in  the  order  in  which  we  shall 
deliver  it. 

X.   Every  cause  in  which  one  side  attacks  and  the 

J 

other  defends  consists  either  of  one  or  more  contro- 
versial questions.  In  the  first  case  it  is  called  simple, 
in  the  second  complex.  An  example  of  the  first  is 
when  the  subject  of  enquiry  is  a  theft  or  an  adultery 
taken  by  itself.  In  complex  cases  the  several  ques- 
tions may  all  be  of  the  same  kind,  as  in  cases  of 
extortion,  or  of  different  kinds,  as  when  a  man  is 
accused  at  one  and  the  same  time  of  homicide  and 
sacrilege.  Such  cases  no  longer  arise  in  the  public 
courts,  since  the  praetor  allots  the  different  charges 
to  different  courts  in  accordance  with  a  definite  rule  ; 
but  they  still  are  of  freqaent  occurrence  in  the 
Imperial  or  Senatorial  courts,  and  were  frequent  in 
the  flays  when  they  came  up  for  trial  before  the 
people.1  Private  suits  again  are  often  tried  by  one 
judge,  who  may  have  to  determine  many  different 
points  of  law.  There  are  no  other  species  of  forensic  2 
causes,  not  even  when  one  person  brings  the  same 
suit  on  the  same  grounds  against  two  different

persons,  or  two  persons  bring  the  same  suit  against 
one,  or  several  against  several,  as  occasionally  occurs 
in  lawsuits  about  inheritances.  Because  although  a 
number  of  parties  may  be  involved,  there  is  still  only 
one  suit,  unless  indeed  the  different  circumstances 
of  the  various  parties  alter  the  questions  at  issue. 

There  is  however  said  to  be  a  third  and  different  3 
class,  the  comparative.  Questions  of  comparison  fre- 
quently require  to  be  handled  in  portions  of  a  cause, 
as  for  instance  in  the  centumviral  court,1  when  after 
other  questions  have  been  raised  the  question  is  dis- 
cussed as  to  which  of  two  claimants  is  the  more  de- 
serving of  an  inheritance.  It  is  rare  however  for  a 
case  to  be  brought  into  court  on  such  grounds  alone, 
as  in  divinations  2  which  take  place  to  determine  who 
the  accuser  shall  be,  and  occasionally  when  two  in- 
formers dispute  as  to  which  has  earned  the  reward. 
Some  again  have  added  a  fourth  class,  namely  4 
mutual  accusation,  which  they  call  avTiKar^yopm. 
Others,  however,  regard  it  as  belonging  to  the  com- 
parative group,  to  which  indeed  the  common  case  of 
reciprocal  suits  on  different  grounds  bears  a  strong 
resemblance.  If  this  latter  case  should  also  be  called 
avTLKaTrjyopia.  (for  it  has  no  special  name  of  its  own),  we 
must  divide  mutual  accusation  into  two  classes,  in  one 
of  which  the  parties  bring  the  same  charge  against 
each  other,  while  in  the  other  they  bring  different 
charges.  The  same  division  will  also  apply  to  claims. 

As  soon  as  we  are  clear  as  to  the  kind  of  cause  on  6 
which  we  are  engaged,  we  must  then  consider 
whether  the  act  that  forms  the  basis  of  the  charge 
is  denied  or  defended,  or  given  another  name  or 
excepted  from  that  class  of  action.  Thus  we  deter- 
mine the  basis  of  each  case.

BOOK    III.   xi.  1-4 

XI.  As  soon  as  these  points  are  ascertained,  the 
next  step,  according  to  Hermagoras,  should  be  to 
consider  what  is  the  question  at  issue,  the  line  of  defence, 
the  point  for  the  judges  decision  and  the  central  point, 
or,  as  others  call  it,  the  foundation  of  the  case.1  The 
question  in  its  more  general  sense  is  taken  to  mean 
everything  on  which  two  or  more  plausible  opinions 
may  be  advanced.  In  forensic  subjects  however  it  2 
must  be  taken  in  two  senses  :  first  in  the  sense  in 
which  we  say  that  a  controversial  matter  involves 
many  questions,  thereby  including  all  minor  ques- 
tions; secondly  in  the  sense  of  the  main  question  on 
which  the  case  turns.  It  is  of  this,  with  which  the 
basis  originates,  that  I  am  now  speaking.  \Ve  ask 
whether  a  thing  has  been  done,  what  it  is  that  hai 
been  done,  and  whether  it  was  rightly  done.  To  3 
these  Hermagoras  arid  Apoliodorus  and  many  other 
writers  have  given  the  special  name  of  questions ; 
Theodorus  on  the  other  hand,  as  I  have  already  said, 
calls  them  general  heads,  while  he  designates  minor 
questions  or  questions  dependent  on  these  general 
heads  as  special  heads.  For  it  is  agreed  that  question 
may  spring  from  question,  and  species  be  subdivided 
into  other  species.  This  main  question,  then,  they  4 
call  the  'Crj-rqiJia..  The  line  of  defence  is  the  method  by 
which  an  admitted  act  is  defended.  I  see  no  reason 
why  1  should  not  use  the  same  example  to  illustrate 
this  point  that  has  been  used  by  practically  all  my 
predecessors.  Orestes  has  killed  his  mother  :  the 
fact  is  admitted.  He  pleads  that  he  was  justified  in 
so  doing:  the  basis  will  be  one  of  qualitv,  the 
question,  whether  he  was  justified  in  his  action,  the 
line  of  defence  that  Clytemnestra  killed  her  husband, 
Orestes'  father.  This  is  called  the  cunoy  or  motive.

BOOK    III.  xi.  4-7 

The  point  for  the  decision  of  the  judge  is  known  as 
the  Kpivofjitvov,  and  in  this  case  is  whether  it  was 
right  that  even  a  guilty  mother  should  be  killed  by 
her  son.  Some  have  drawn  a  distinction  between  5 
aiTiov  and  CUTUX,  making  amov  mean  the  cause  of  the 
trial,  namely  the  murder  of  Clytemnestra,  atrt'a  the 
motive  urged  in  defence,  namely  the  murder  of 
Agamemnon.  But  there  is  such  lack  of  agreement 
over  these  two  words,  that  some  make  ama  the  cause 
of  the  trial  and  amor  the  motive  of  the  deed,  while 
others  reverse  the  meanings.  If  we  turn  to  Latin 
writers  we  find  that  some  have  given  these  causes  the 
names  of  initium,  the  beginning,  and  ratio,  the  reason, 
while  others  give  the  same  name  to  both.  Moreover  6 
cause  seems  to  spring  from  cause,  or  as  the  Greeks  say 
alnov  e£  alriov,  as  will  be  seen  from  the  following:— 
Clytemnestra  killed  Agamemnon,  because  he  had 
sacrificed  their  daughter  and  brought  home  a  captive 
woman  as  his  paramour.  The  same  authors  think 
that  there  may  be  several  lines  of  defence  to  one 
question :  for  instance  Orestes  may  urge  that  he 
killed  his  mother  because  driven  to  do  so  by  oracles. 
But  the  number  of  points  for  the  decision  of  the  judge 
will  be  the  same  as  the  number  of  alleged  motives  for 
the  deed  :  in  this  case  it  will  be  whether  he  ought  to 
have  obeyed  the  oracles.  But  one  alleged  motive  may  7 
also  in  my  opinion  involve  several  questions  and  several 
points  for  the  decision  of  the  judge,  as  for  instance 
in  the  case  when  the  husband  caught  his  wife  in 
adultery  and  slew  her  and  later  slew  the  adulterer, 
who  had  escaped,  in  the  market  place.  The  motice  is 
but  one:  "he  was  an  adulterer."  But  there  arise 
as  questions  and  points  for  decision  by  the  judge,  whether

it  was  lawful  to  kill  him  at  that  time  and  at  that 
place.  But  just  as,  although  there  be  several  questions,  8 
each  with  its  special  basis,  the  basis  of  the  case  is  but 
one,  namely  that  to  which  all  else  is  referred,  even  so 
the  real  point  for  the  decision  of  the  judge  is,  strictly 
speaking,  that  on  which  judgment  is  given.  As  for  9 
the  <TVI'€)(OV,  the  central  argument,  as  I  have  mentioned 
it  is  called  by  some,  or  the \  foundation  as  it  is  called  by 
others,  or  as  Cicero  l  styles  it  the  strongest  argument  of 
the  defender  and  the  most  relevant  to  the  decision  of  the 
judge,  some  regard  it  as  being  the  point  after  which 
all  enquiry  ceases,  others  as  the  main  point  for 
adjudication.  The  motive  of  the  deed  does  not  arise  10 
in  all  controversial  cases.  For  how  can  there  be  a 
motive  for  the  deed,  when  the  deed  is  denied?  But 
when  the  motive  for  the  deed  does  come  up  for 
discussion,  they  deny  that  the  point  for  the  decision  of 
the  judge  rests  on  the  same  ground  as  the  main  question 
at  issue,  and  this  view  is  maintained  by  Cicero  2  in  his 
Rhetorica  and  Partitiones.  For  when  it  has  been  11 
asserted  and  denied  that  a  deed  was  done,  the  ques- 
tion whether  it  was  done  is  resolved  by  conjecture,  and 
the  decision  of  the  judge  and  the  main  question  rest  on 
the  same  ground,  since  the  first  question  and  the 
final  decision  are  concerned  with  the  same  point. 
But  when  it  is  stated  and  denied  that  Orestes  was 
justified  in  killing  his  mother,  considerations  of  quality 
are  introduced  :  the  question  is  whether  he  was  justi- 
fied in  killing  her,  but  this  is  not  yet  the  point  for  the 
decision  of  the  judge.  When,  then,  does  it  become  so  ? 
"She  killed  my  father."  "  Yes,  but  that  did  not 
make  it  your  duty  to  murder  your  mother."  The 
point  for  the  decision  of  the  judge  is  whether  it  was  his 
duty  to  kill  her.  As  regards  the  foundation,  I  will  put  12

it  in  the  words  of  Cicero  l  himself : — "  The  foundation 
is  the  strongest  argument  for  the  defence,  as  for 
instance,  if  Orestes  were  ready  to  say  that  the  dispo- 
sition of  his  mother  towards  his  father,  himself  and 
his  sisters,  the  kingdom,  the  reputation  of  the  race 
and  the  family  were  such  that  it  was  the  peculiar  duty 
of  her  children  to  punish  her."  Others  again  use  13 
illustrations  such  as  the  following : — "  He  who  has 
spent  his  patrimony,  is  not  allowed  to  address  the 
people."  "But  he  spent  it  on  public  works."  The 
question  is  whether  everyone  that  spends  his  patrimony 
is  to  be  prohibited,  while  the  point  for  decision  is 
whether  he  who  spent  it  in  such  a  way  is  to  be 
prohibited.  Or  again  take  the  case  of  the  soldier  14 
Arruntius,  who  killed  the  tribune  Lusius  for  assaulting 
his  honour.  The  question  is  whether  he  was  justified 
in  so  doing,  the  line  of  defence,  that  the  murdered  man 
made  an  assault  upon  his  honour,  the  point  for  the 
decision  of  the  judge,  whether  it  was  right  that  a  man 
should  be  killed  uncondemned  or  a  tribune  by  a 
soldier.  Some  even  regard  the  basis  of  the  question  15 
as  being  different  from  the  basis  of  the  decision. 
The  question  as  to  whether  Milo  was  justified  in 
killing  Clodius,  is  one  of  quality.  The  point  for  the 
decision  of  the  judge,  namely  whether  Clodius  lay  in 
wait  for  Milo,  is  a  matter  for  conjecture.  They  also  16 
urge  that  a  case  is  often  diverted  to  the  consideration 
of  some  matter  irrelevant  to  the  question,  and  that  it  is 
on  this  matter  that  judgment  is  given.  I  strongly 
disagree.  Take  the  question  whether  all  who  have 
spent  their  patrimony  are  to  be  prohibited  from 
addressing  the  people.  This  question  must  have  its 
point  for  decision,  and  therefore  the  question  and  the 
point  for  decision  are  not  different,  but  there  are  more

than  one  question  and  more  than  one  point  for  decision 
in  the  case.  Again,  in  the  case  of  Milo,  is  not  the  17 
question  of  fact  ultimately  referred  to  the  question  of 
quality  ?  For  if  Clodius  lay  in  wait  for  Milo,  it  follows 
that  he  was  justifiably  killed.  But  when  the  case  is 
shifted  to  some  other  point  far  removed  from  the 
original  question,  even  in  this  case  the  question  will 
be  found  to  reside  in  the  point  for  decision. 

As  regards  these  questions  Cicero  is  slightly  in-  18 
consistent  with  himself.  For  in  the  Rhetorica,  as  I 
have  already  mentioned,  he  followed  Hermagoras, 
while  in  the  Topica l  he  holds  that  the  /cpivo/xevov  or 
disputed  point  is  originated  by  the  basis,  and  in 
addressing  the  lawyer  Trebatius  on  this  subject  he 
calls  it  the  point  at  issue,  and  describes  the  elements 
in  which  it  resides  as  central  arguments  or  foundations 
of  the  defence  which  hold  it  together  and  the  removal  of 
which  causes  the  whole  defence  to  fall  to  the  ground.  But  19 
in  the  Partitiones  Oratoriae2  he  gives  the  name  of 
foundation  to  that  which  is  advanced  against  the  de- 
fence, on  the  ground  that  the  central  argument,  as  it 
logically  comes  first,  is  put  forward  by  the  accuser, 
while  the  line  of  defence  is  put  forward  by  the  accused, 
and  the  point  for  the  decision  of  the  judge  arises  from 
the  question  jointly  raised  by  the  central  argument 
and  the  line  of  defence. 

The  view  therefore  of  those  who  make  the  basis, 
the  central  argument,  and  the  point  for  the  decision  of 
the  judge  identical,  is  at  once  more  concise  and  nearer 
to  the  truth.  The  central  argument,  they  point  out, 
is  that  the  removal  of  which  makes  the  whole  case  fall 
to  the  ground.  In  this  central  argument  they  seem  to  20 
me  to  have  included  both  the  alleged  causes,  that

BOOK    III.  xi.  20-24 

Orestes  killed  his  mother  and  that  Clytemnestra 
killed  Agamemnon.  The  same  authorities  have  like- 

c_» 

wise  always  held  that  the  basis  and  the  point  for  the 
decision  of  the  judge  are  in  agreement;  any  other 
opinion  would  have  been  inconsistent  with  their 
general  views. 

But  this  affectation  of  subtlety  in  the  invention  of  21 
technical  terms  is  mere  laborious  ostentation  :  I  have 
undertaken  the  task  of  discussing  them  solely  that  I 
might  not  be  regarded  as  having  failed  to  make  suffi- 
cient inquiry  into  the  subject  which  I  have  chosen  as 
my  theme.  But  it  is  quite  unnecessary  for  an  in- 
structor proceeding  on  less  technical  lines  to  destroy 
the  coherence  of  his  teaching  by  attention  to  such 
minute  detail.  Many  however  suffer  from  this  draw-  22 
back,  more  especially  Hermagoras  who,  although  he 
labours  these  points  with  such  anxious  diligence,  was 
a  man  of  penetrating  intellect  and  in  most  respects 
deserves  our  admiration,  so  that  even  where  we  must 
needs  blame  him,  we  cannot  withhold  a  certain  meed 
of  praise.  But  the  shorter  method,  which  for  that  23 
very  reason  is  also  by  far  the  most  lucid,  will  not 
fatigue  the  learner  by  leading  him  through  a  maze  of 
detail,  nor  destroy  the  coherence  of  his  eloquence  by 
breaking  it  up  into  a  number  of  minute  departments. 
For  he  who  has  a  clear  view  of  the  main  issue  of  a  dis- 
pute, and  divines  the  aims  which  his  own  side  and  his 
opponents  intend  to  follow  and  the  means  they  intend 
to  employ  (and  it  is  to  the  intentions  of  his  own  side 
that  he  must  pay  special  attention),  will  without  a 
doubt  be  in  possession  of  a  knowledge  of  all  the  points 
which  1  have  discussed  above.  And  there  is  hardly  24 
anyone,  unless  he  be  a  born  fool  without  the  least 
acquaintance  with  the  practice  of  speaking,  who  does

not  know  what  is  the  main  issue  of  a  dispute  (or  as 
they  call  it  the  cause  or  central  argument)  and  what  is 
the  question  between  the  parties  and  the  point  on  which 
the  judge  has  to  decide,  these  three  being  identical. 
For  the  question  is  concerned  with  the  matter  in  dis- 
pute and  the  decision  of  the  judge  is  given  on  the 
point  involved  in  the  question.  Still  we  do  not  keep  25 
our  attention  rigidly  fixed  on  such  details,  but  the 
desire  to  win  praise  by  any  available  means  and  the 
sheer  delight  in  speaking  make  us  wander  away  from 
the  subject,  since  there  is  always  richer  material  for 
eloquence  outside  the  strict  theme  of  the  case,  inas- 
much as  the  points  of  any  given  dispute  are  always 
few,  and  there  is  all  the  world  outside,  and  in  the  one 
case  we  speak  according  to  our  instructions,  in  the 
other  on  the  subjects  of  our  own  choice.  We  should  26 
teach  not  so  much  that  it  is  our  duty  to  discover  the 
question,  the  central  argument.,  and  the  point  for  the  de- 
cision of  the  judge  (an  easy  task),  as  that  we  should 
continually  keep  our  attention  on  our  subject,  or  if 
we  digress,  at  least  keep  looking  back  to  it,  lest  in 
our  desire  to  win  applause  we  should  let  our  weapons 
drop  from  our  grasp.  The  school  of  Theodorus,  as  I  27 
have  said,  groups  everything  under  heads,  by  which 
they  mean  several  things.  First  they  mean  the  main 
question,  which  is  to  be  identified  with  the  basis ; 
secondly  they  mean  the  other  questions  dependent 
on  the  main  question,  thirdly  the  proposition  and  the 
statement  of  the  proofs.  The  word  is  used  as  we  use  it 
when  we  say  "  It  is  the  head  of  the  whole  business," 
or,  as  Menander  says,  K<r<£uA.atuv  etrrii/ J  But  generally 
speaking,  anything  which  has  to  be  proved  will  be  a 
head  of  varying  degrees  of  importance.
