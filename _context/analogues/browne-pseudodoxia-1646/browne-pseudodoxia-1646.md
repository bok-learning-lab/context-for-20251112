Art and fallacy was uſed unto her,a naked offer proved ſufficient unto him: ſo his ſuperſtru- ; Rion was his ruin, 6c the fertility of his ſlcep,an.iflue of death unto him, ' And although the condition of ſex & poſterity of creation might ſome- | what cxtenuate the crior of the woman : Yet was it very ſtrange and | incxcuſable in the man, eſpecially if as ſome afficme, he was the wiſcſt | of all men ſince, or if as others have conceived, he was not ignorant of | thefall of the Angels, and hadthereby example and puniſhment to de- | terre him, They were deceived from themſclvyes, and their owne apprehenſi- - ons, for Eve cither miſtooke or traduced the commandement of God. | Of every tree of the garden thou maicſt freely eat, butof thetree of | | knowledge of good and cvill thou ſhalt not cat, for in the day thou ca- | teſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye.

that it was pleaſant unto the eye, and atree to be defired to make one wiſe, ſhe tooke of the fruit thereof and did eat. Now hereby it appea- reth, that Eve before the fall, was by the ſame and beaten way of al- lurements inveigled , whereby her poſterity hath been deluded ever fince; that is thoſe three delivered by St. John, the luſt of the fleſh,the luſt of theeye, and the pride of life, wherein indeed they ſeemed as weakly to faile as their debilitated poſterity, ever after. Whereof not- withſtanding ſome intheir imperteRions , have reſiſted inore power- full remptations, and in many moralities condemned the facility of their ſeductions. Againe, they might for ought we know, be ſtiil deceivedin the un- belicte of their mortality even aſter they had cat of the fruir. For Eve obſerving no immediate execution of the curſe, ſhe delivered the fruit unto Adam , who after the taſte thereof , perceiving himſelfe ſtill to
which perhaps he did not indubitably believe, untill he was after con- victed inthe viſible example of Abel ; for he that would not belicve the menace of God at firſt, it may be doubted whether before an ocu- lar example hee believed the curſe at laſt , and therefore they are not without all reaſon, who have diſpancd the fact of Cain,that is alchough he purpoſed to miſchicte, whether he intended to murther his brother, or defignedthat , whereof he had not beheld anexample in his owne kinde, there might be fomewhat in it that he would not have done, or deſired undone , when he brake forth as deſperately as before hee had done unmannerly, My iniquity is greater then can be forgiven me. Scme nicities I confeſle there are which extenuate, but many more that aggravate this deluſion, which exceeding the bounds of our Diſl- courſe, and perhaps our ſatisfaRion,we ſhall at preſent paſſe over. And therefore whether the ſinne of our firſt parents were the greateſt of any ſince, whetherthe tranſgreſſion of Eve ſeducing, did not exceed that of Adam ſeduced, or whether the refiſtibiliry of his reaſon did not e- quivalence the facility of her ſeduQion , wee ſhall referre it untothe Schoolman. Whether there were not in Eve as great injuſtice in decei- ving her husband, as imprudence in being deceived her ſelf, we leave it unto the Morallift. Whether the whole relation be nat Allegoricall,

nine faculties : or whether thetree in the middeſt of the garden, were not that part in the centre of the body, on which was afterward the a
pointment of circumcifion in males , we leaye it unto the Thalmudiſt, Whether there were any policic in the devill to tempt them before conjunRion, or whether the iſſue before tentation might in juſtice have ſoffered with thoſe after, we leave it unto the Lawyer. Whether A- | dam foreknew the advent of Chriſt , or the reparation of his error by his Saviour, how the execution of the curſe ſhould have been ordered, ifafter Eve had eaten, Adam had yet refuſed. Whether it they had {taſted rhe tree of life before that of good and evill, they had yet ſuffe- red the curſe of mortality or whether the efficacie of the onehad not
 {overpowred the penalty of the other, we leave it unto God : for he a-
lone can truly determine theſe and all things clſe, who as he hath pro- | poſed the world unto our diſputation, ſo hath he reſerved many things unto his owne reſolution, whoſe determinations we cannot hope from fleſb, but muſt with reverence ſuſpend unto that great day, whoſe ju- ſtice ſhall either condemne our curiofities, or reſolve our diſquifitions, 'Laſtly, man was not only deceiveable in his integrity, but the An- gells of lightinall their clarity. He that ſaid he would bee like the higheft did crre if in ſome way he conceived himſelfe not fo already; bur in attempting ſo high an effeR from himſelfe, hee miſ-underftood the nature of God, and held a falſc apprehenſion of his owne, where- by vainly attempting not only inſolencies, but impoſſibilities , he de- ceived himſclfe as low as hell. In bricfe,there is nothing infallible but God,who cannot poſſibly erre. For thingsare really true as they cor- |
of conformity unto that intelle®,in whoſe Ideathey had their firſt de-

replyed; I heard chy voice in the garden, and becauſe I was naked, 1 hid my ſelfe : In which reply , there was included a very grofle mi. | ſtake, and if with pertinacity maintained, a high and capitall errour: for |
ged the omniſciency and eſſential ubiquity of his Makers who as he created all things, ſo is he beyond and in them all, not onely in power, | as under his ſubjeRion, or in his preſence,as being in his cognition, bur | in his very Eſſence,as being the ſoule of their caulalities, and the eſlen- | tiall cauſe of their exiſtences. Certainely his poſterity at this diſtance and after ſo perpetuated an impayrement , cannot but condemnethe | poverty of his conception, thar thought to obſcure himſelfe from his Creator inthe ſhade of the garden, who had beheld him before in the darkenefſe of his Chaos , and in the obſcurity of nothing ; that chought to flye from God, which could not flye himſelfe, or imagined that one tree ſhould conceale his nakedneſle from Gods eye,as another had revealed it unto his owne. Thoſe tormented ſpirits that wiſh the mountaines to cover them, have fallen upon deſires of lefle abſurdity, | and choſen wayes of leſſe improbable concealement ; though this be alſo as ridiculous unto reaſon, as fruitlefle unto their defires; for he that | laid the foundations of the earth , cannot be excluded the ſecrecy of the mountains, nor can there any thing eſcape the perſpicacity of thoſe eyes which were before light, and unto whole opticks there is no opa- city. This is the conſolation of all good men, unto whom his ubiqui- ty affordeth continuall comfort and ſecurity : And this is the affli&i- on of hell, unto whom it affordeth deſpaire, and remedileſſe calamity. For thoſe reſtleſle ſpirits that flye the face ofthe Almighty, being de-
rived the fruition of his eye , would alſo avoid the extent of his
and; which being impoſſible, their ſufferings are deſperate, and their afflitions without evaſion, untill they can get our of Triſmegiſtus his | circle, that is, tocxtend their wings above the univerſe, and pitch be- yond ubiquity it ſelfe.
thou gaveſt me to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did cate : this indeed was a very unſatisfaRory reply , and therein was involved a very impions errour, as implying God the Author of finne, and accu- ſing his Maker of his franſgrefſion : as if he had ſaid, If thou hadft not given mea woman I had not beene deceived: Thou promiſedſt to make her a help, but ſhe hath proved deſtrution unto me; had I re- mained alone, Thad not finned, but thou gaveſt me a conſort, and fo 1 became ſeduced. This was a bold and open accuſation of God, ma- king the fountaine of good the contriver of evill, and the forbidderof the crime an abetter ofthe fa prohibited. Surely, his mercy was great that did not e the impeachment of his Juſtices and his

ment of his excuſation, or onely purſued the firſt cranſgreſſion without a penalty of this the ſecond.
The third was that of Eve. The Serpent beguiled me, and I did | cate. In which reply there was not onely a very feeble excuſe , but an erroneous tranſlating her owne offence upon another, Extenuating her | finne from that which was an aggravation, that is to excuſe the faR ar
all, much more upon the _— of a beaſt, which was before in the ſtriteſt termesprohibited by her God. For although we now doe hope the mercies of God will conſider our degenerated integrities unto ſome minoration of our offences, yet had not the ſincerity of our | firſt parents, ſo colourable expeRations , unto whom the commande- ment was but ſingle, and their integritics beſt able to reſiſt the motions of its tranſgreſſion: And therefore ſo hainous conceptions have riſen hereof, that ſome have ſeemed more angry therewith then God him- ſelfe, being ſo exaſperated with the offence, as to call in queſtion their ſalvation, and to diſpute the cternall puniſhment of their Maker. Afſſu- | redly with better reaſon may poſterity accuſe them, then they the Ser- pent, or one another ; and the diſpleaſure of the Pelagians muſt needs be irrcconcileable, who peremptorily maintaining they can fulfill the whole Law , will inſatisfaRorily condemne the non-oblervation of one.
The fourth was that ſpeech of Cain upon the demand of God, Where is thy Brother £ and he ſaid, I'know not. In which negation, beſide the open impudence, there was implyed a notableerrour ; for
off the Searcher of hearts, hedenied the omniſciency of God, where- unto there is nothing concealable. The anſwer of Satan in the caſe of Job, had more of truth, wiſdome and reverence, then this; Whence
commeſt thou Satan ? and he ſaid, from compaſſing of the earth. For |
though an enemy of God, and hater of all truth, his wiſdome will hardly permic him to falfifie with the Almighty : for well underſtan- ding the omniſcience of his nature, he is not ſo ready to deceive him- ſelte, as to falſific unto him whoſe cognition is no way deludable: And therefore when in the tentation of Chriſt he played upon the falacy, and thought to deceive the Author of truth , the method of this pro- ceeding aroſe from the uncertainty of his divinity, whereof had he re- mained affured, he had continued filent , ner would his diſcretion at- tempt ſo unſacceedable a temptation. And ſo againe at the laſt day, when our offences ſhall be drawne into accompt , the ſubtilty of that Inquifitor ſhall not preſent unto God a bundle of calumnies or confu- table accuſations , but will diſcreetly offer up unto his Omniſciencie,
a ſure and undeniable liſt of our tranſgreſſions. The fifth is another reply of Cain upon the denouncement of his curſe, My iniquity is greater then can be forgiven: For ſois it a_ | ed

ſed in ſome tranſlations. The afſertion was not onely deſperate
| his mercy, and conceiving the finne of murder unpardonable ; which
how greatſocver, is not above the repentance of man , but far below | the mercics of God, and was as ſome conceive expiated,in that puniſh- metit he ſuffered temporally for ir, There are bur ewo' examples of this errour in holy Scripture, and they both for murder, and both as it were of the ſame perſon ; for Chriſt was myſtically flaine in Abel z | and therefore Cain had ſome influence on his death, as well as Judas ; butthe finne had a different effec on Cain, from that it had on Judas, | and moſt that fince ave fallen into it, forthey like Judas deſire death, and not unfrequently purſue it: Cain on the contrary grewafraid there-
bur | the conceit erroneous , overthrowing that glorious attribute of God
of, and obtained a ſecurement from it. Afſuredly it his deſpaire con-  tinued, there was puniſhment enough inlife, and juſtice ſufficient in | the mercy of his proteRion. For the lite of the deſperate equals the | anxieties of death, who in unceſſant inquietudes but a the life of the | damned, and anticipate the deſolations of hell. Tis indeed a finne in ' man, butapuniſhment onely in the devils, who offend not God but | -2fli& themſelves, in the appointed deſpaire of his mercies. And asto | be withourall hope is the affiction of the damned, ſo is icthe happi-
| neſle of the blefled, who having their expeRations preſent, are not di- }
| ſtrated with futurities. So is ic alſo their felicity to have no faich, for
: enjoying the beatifical viſion there is nothing unto them incvident,and }
in the fruition of the obje of faith, they have received the full evacuation of it.
The laſt ſpeech was that of Lamech, T have ſlaine a man to my | wound, and a young manto my hurt: If Cain be avenged ſeven fold, truly Lamech ſeventy and ſeven fold. Now herein there ſeemes to be | a very crroneous illation; fromthe indulgence of God unto Cain, con- | cluding an immunity unto himſelfe, that is,a regular proteRion from a ſingle example, and anexcmption from puniſhment in a fat that natu- 'rally deſervedit. The Ecror of this offendor was contrary to that of Cain, whom the Rabbins conceive that Lamech at this time killed. ' He deſpaired of Gods mercy 1n the ſame fat , where this preſumed of it; he by a decollation of all hope annihilated his mercy, this by an im- moderancy thereof deſtroyed his juſtice; though the ſin were lefſe,the errour was as great ; For as it is untrue that his mercy will not forgive | offenders, or his benignity cooperate to their converſions, So is it alſo of no leſle falfity to afficme his Juſtice will notexaR account of fin- |
ners, Or puniſh ſuch as continae in their tranſgreſſions.
And thus may we perceive , how weakely our fathers did erre be- fore the floud, how continually and upon common diſcourſe they fell upon errours after, it is therefore no wonder we have been erroneous»

C H APs I I I . Of the ſecond cauſe of Popular Errors ; the erroneous diſpoſition of the people,
| i-j Aving thus declared the fallible nature of man even from his firſt | produRion, we have beheld the | _— cauſe of error, but as for | |
popular errors,they are more neerely tounded upon anerroneous incli- | nation of the people;as being the moſt deceptible part of mankind,and | * ready with open armes to receive the encroachments of Error, which condition of theirs although deduceable from many grounds, yet ſhall weevidencec it, but from a few , and ſuch as moſt neerely and undeni- ; ably declare their natures. |
How unequall diſcerners of truth they are, and openly expoſed unto errour, will firſt appeare from their unqualified intelleQuals, unable to umpire the difficulty of its difſentions. For Error to ſpeake ſtriQty, is a firme aſſent unto falſity. Now whether the obje&t whereunto they dcliver uptheir aſſent be true or falſe, they are incompetent judges.
For the aſſured truth of things is derived from the principles of | |} knowledge, and cauſes, which determine their verities ; whereof their | unculrivated underſtandings, ſcarce holding any theory, they are but | bad diſcerners of verity, and in the numerous traR of error, but caſual- | } ly do hit the point and unity of truth, |
Their underſtanding is ſo feeble in the diſcernement of falfities , and averting the errors of reaſon, that it ſubmitteth unto the fallacics of ſence, and is unable to reQifie the error of its ſenſations. Thus the | ercater part of mankinde having but one cye of ſence and reaſon, con- ceive the carth farre bigger then the Sun, the fixed Stars leſſer thenthe Moone, their figures plaine , and their ſpaces equidiſtant. For thus their ſence enformech them , and herein their reaſon cannot reQifie them, and therefore hopeleſly continuing in their miſtakes, they live and dye intheirabſurdities paſſing their dayes in perverted apprehen- fions, and conceptions of the world, derogatory unto God , and the | wiſdorme of his creation.
Againe, being fo illiterate in point of intelle&, and their ſence ſo incorreted , they are farther indiſpoſed ever to attaine unto truth, as commonly proceeding in thoſe wayes, which have moſt reference un- to ſence, and wherein there lyeth moſt notable and popular deluſion :
For being unable to weild the intelleRuall armes of reaſon, they are
faine to betake themſelves unto waſters and the blunter weapons of truth; affeCting the grofle and ſenſible wayes of doQrine, and ſuch as will not conſiſt with ftriR and ſubtile reaſon. Thus untothem a piece

of Rhetorick is aſufficient argument of Logick,an Apologue of Aſope, | beyond a Syllogiſme in Barbara, parables then propoſitions, and pro- | | verbs more powertull,then demonſtrations. And therefore are they | | led rather by example, then precept, receiving perſwaſions from viſt- | ble inducements, before intelleual inſtruRions; and therefore alſo do they judge of humane aQions by the event; for being uncapable of | operable circumſtances,or rightly to judgethe prudenciality of affairs, | | they onely gaze upon the viſible ſucceſle, and thereafter condemn or | ; cry up the whole progreſſion. And ſo from this ground inthe LeQure | | of holy Scripture, their apprehenſions, are commonly confined unto | the literall ſence of the text , from whence have enſued the groſle and | duller ſort of herefics. For not attaining the deuteroſcopy, and ſecond | intention of the words , they are faine to omit their ſuperconſequen- | cies, coherencies, figures,or tropologies and are not ſometime perſwa- | | ded by fire beyond their literalities. And therefore allo things invi- | | ſible, but unto intelleRuall diſcernments, to humor the grofſeneſle of | | their comprehenſions, have been degraded from their proper forms, * | and God himſelfe diſhonoured into manuall expreſſions ; and fo like- | wiſe being unprovided , or unſufficient for higher ſpeculations , they | will alwayes betake themſclves, unto ſenſible repreſentations, and can | | hardly be reſtrained the dulneſs of Idolatry. A finne or folly not on- | ly derogatory unto God, but man, overthrowing their reaſon,as well | as his divinitic. In briefe a reciprocation, or rather an Inverſion of the | creation, making God one way , as he made us another , that is, after our Image,as he made us after his owne.
Moreover, their underſtanding thus weake in it ſelfe,and perverted by ſenſiblg deluſions, is yet farther impaired by the dominion of their appetite, thatis , the irrational and brutall part of the ſoule , which lording it over the ſoveraigne facultic , interrupts che aRions of that noble part, and choakes thoſe tender ſparkes , which Adam hath left themof reaſon: and therefore they doe not onely ſwarm with errours, but vices depending thereon, Thus they commonly affeR no man any farther then hee deſerts his reaſon, or complies with their aberrancies. Hence they embrace not vertue for it ſelfe, but its reward , and the ar- gument from pleaſure or utilitie is farre mure powerfull,then that from vertuous honeſty: which Mahomet and his contrivers wel underſtood, when hee ſet out the felicitie of his heaven, by the contentments of fleſh, and the delights of ſenſe: {lightly paſſing over the accompliſh- ment of the ſoule, and the beatitude of that pare which carth and viſi- bilities too weakly affet. But the wiſdom of onr Saviour,and the fim- plicity of his truth proceeded another way, defying the popular provi- ſons of happineſſe from ſenſible expeRations , placing his felicitie in things removed fromſenſe, and the intelleuall enjoyment of God.

Againe, their individuall imperfeRions being great, they are more- over enlarged by their aggregation, and being erroneous in their ſingle numbers once hudled together, they will be errour it ſelfe ; for being 2 confuſion of knaves and fookes, and a farraginous concurrence of all conditions, tempers, fex, and ages, it is but naturall if their determina- tions be monſtrous, and many wayes inconſiſtent with truth. And therefore wile men have alwayes applauded theirowne judgement, in the contradiRion of that of the people, and their ſobereſt adverſaries, have ever afforded them the ſtile of fooles and mad meay and to ſpeak impurially,their ations have often made good theſe Epithites.

For trueitis, ( and Thope ſhall not offend their vulgatities ) if I ſay they are daily mocked into errour by ſubtler deviſors,and have been expreſly deluded , by all profeſſions whatſoever. Thus the Priefts of Eldertime , have put upon them many incredible conceits , not onely deluding their apprehenſions, with Ariolation, South-ſaying, and ſuch oblique Idolatries, but win- ning their credulities unto the literal] and downe-right adorement of Cats, Lizards,and Bcetles; and thus alſo in ſome Chriſtian Churches,
whereinis preſumed an irreproveable truth, If all be true thar is ſuſpe- Red, or halfe what is related, there have not wanted,many ſtrange de- ceptions , and ſome thereot are ſtill confeſſed by the name of Pious fraudes. Thus Theudas an Impoſture was able to lead away foure thouſand into the wildernefle, and the deluſions of Mahomet almoſt che fourth part of mankinde. Thus all herefics how grofſle ſoever, have | found a welcome with the people. For thus, what is ſcarce imaginable | many of the Jews were wrought into beliefe,that Herod was the Mel- | fias, and David Georgeof Leyden and Arden, were not without a par- ' tieamonegſt the people , who maintained the ſame opinion of them- | ſelves almoſt in our dayes.

Of the nearer and more Immediate Cauſes of popular errors, both in the Wiſer and common ſort, CMiſapprehenſion, Fallacy,or falſe didultion, Credality, Supinity, adberence unto cAntiquitie, Tradition, and eAuthoritie,
T** $rſt is a miſtake, or a conception of things, either in their firſt | apprehenſions, or ſecondary relations. So Eve miſtook the Com- mandement, either from the immediate injunRion of God,or from the ſecondary narration of her husband. So might the Diſciples miſtake our Saviour, in his anſwer unto Peter , concerning the death of John, as is delivered, John 21. Peter fecing John, ſaith unto Jeſus, Lord,and what ſhall this man doe * Jeſus ſaich, It I will, that he tarry till I come, what is that unto thee * Then went this ſaying abroad among the bre- thren, that that Diſciple ſhould not die. Thus began the conceit and opinion of the Centaures, that is in the miſtake of the firſt beholders, as is declared by Servius; when ſome young Theſlalians on horſe- backe were beheld a farre off, while their horſes watered, that is, while their heads were depreſſed , they were conceived by their firſt ſpea- tors,to be but one animall,and anſwerable hereunto have their piQures been drawn ever fince. |
And as ſimple miſtakes commonly beget fallacies , ſo men reſt not in falſe apprehenfions, without abſurd and inconſequene diduRions, from fallacious foundations, and miſapprehended mediums, ercRing concluſions no way inferrible from their premiſes. Now the fallacics whereby men deceive others, and are deceived themſelves, the Anci- | ents, have divided into Verball and Reall. Of the Verball, and ſuch as conclude from miftakes of the word, although there be no lefſe then ſixe, yet are there but two onely thereof worthy our notation : and unto which the reſt may be referred : that is the fallacie of Aquivo- | cation and Amphibologie , which conclude from the ambiguity of ſome one word,or the ambiguous fintaxisof many put together. From
the Propheſies of their Mefſias, and expounding them alwayes | untoliterall and temporall expeQation. By this way many errors crept in and perverted the doctrine of Pythagoras , whileſt men received his precepts in a different ſenſe from his intention, converting Meta- phors into propricties,and receiving as litterall expreffions,obſcure and involved truths. Thus when he enjoyned his Diſciples, an abſtinence from beanes, many conceived they were with ſeverity debarred the ule of that pulſe; which notwithſtanding could not be his meaning; for as Ariſtoxenus who wrote his life, averrcth he delighted much io that kind of focd himſelfe; but herein as Plutarch obſerveth, he had no 0- ther intention, then to difſwade men from Magiftracie, or underta- king the publike offices of ſtate; for by beanes were the Magiſtrates e- | leted

Other wayes there are of deceit which conſiſt not ,, in falle appre- henſion of ads , thatis verball cxpretkons or ſeaxcntiall fignificati- ons, bu fraudulent deduQtions, or inconfequent iHations, from a falſe conception of things. Of theſe extradiQionary and reall fallacies, Avi. Rotle and Logicians make in number fix, but we obſerve that men arc woſt commonly deceived by foure thereof : thoſe aze, Feeitio privet- pii, A ditto ſecundum quid 4d dictum funyliciter. A nov cauſa p10 canſa, And fallacia conſequents. Xl
The firſt is pe#:410 principii , which fallacie is committed , when 4 queſtion is madea medium, or we aſſume a medium as granted, where- of we remaine as uoſatisfied as of the queſtion. Briefly where that is aſſumed as principle, ro prove another thing which is not conceaded as true it ſelfe. By this fallacie was Eve deceived , when thee took for granted, the falſe aſſertion of the devill ; Yee ſhall not ſwely =— God doth know that in the day ſhe ſhall cat thereof, your eyes ſhall be opened, and you ſhall be as gods z which was hut a bare affirmation of
Satan withour any proofe or probable inducement, contrary unto the | command of God and former beliefe of herſelfe ; and this was the Lo- gick of the Jews, when they accuſed our Saviour unto Pilate, who de- | mandivg a reafonable impeachment, or theallegation of. ſome crime worthy of condemnation,they only replyed,if he had not been worthy of dexth, we would not have was neither accuſation of the perſon,nor ſatisfaRtion of the Judge, who | well underſtood a bare accuſation was no preſumption clamors of the people no accuſation at all. The fame is
time uſed inthe diſpute, between Job, and his friends, they often ta- king that for granted which afterward he denyeth and diſproveth. The ſecond is 4 difo ſecundam quid ad dittum ſimpliciter , when
abſolute verity is inferred , transferring the ſpeciall confideration of
acception , unto that withour all limitation. This falacie men commit whenthey argue from a particular toa generall , as when we conclude the vices or qualities of a few upon a whole Nation;or from a part un- tothe whole: Thus the divell argued with our Saviour , and by this he would perſwade him he might be ſecure if hee caſt himaſclfe from the pinacle : for ſaid he, ic is written, he ſhall give his Angels charge. concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall beare thee up, leſt at any | time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.

Enquiries into Pulgar Book 1,
incroachment Idolatry firſt crept in , men converting the ſymbolicall
uſe of Idols into their proper worſhip, and receiving the repreſentation of things as the ſubſtance and thing it ſelfe. So the ſtatue of Belus at firſt ereed in his memory,was in after times adored as aDivinity. And ſo alſo in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt , the bread and wine which were but the ls or viſible fignes, were madethe things fignificd, and worſhipped for the bedy of Chriſt. And hereby generally men are deceived that take things ſpoken in ſome latitude without any at all. Hereby the Jewes were deceived concerning the commandement of the Sabbath, accufing our Saviour for healing the ſicke , and his diſci- ples for plucking the cars of corne, upon that day. And by this deplo- rable miſtake they were deceived unto deſtruQion, upon the aſſault of Pompey the great made upon that day , by whoſe ſuperſtitious obſer- vation they could not defend themſclyes , or performe any labour whatſoever.
The third is a #8» ca#ſ2 pro cauſa, when that is pretended for a cauſe which is not, or not in that ſenſe which is inferred. Upon this conſe- quence the law of Mahomet forbids the uſe of wine, and his ſucceſſors aboliſhed Univerſities : by this alſo many Chriftians have condemned literature, miſunderſtanding the counſcll of Saint Paul, who adviſeth no further thento beware of Philoſophy. On this foundation were built the concluſions of Sonthſayers in their Auguriall,and Tripudia- ry divinations , colleRing preſages from voice or food of birds, and conjoyning events unto cauſes of no connexion. Hereupon alſo are
the groſſe miſtakes , in the cure of many diſeaſes , not only from the laſt medicine,and ſympatheticall receits,but amulets charms, and all incantatory applications , deriving effects not only from incon- curring cauſes, but things devoid of all efficiencie whatever.
The fourth is the fallacic of the conſequent , which if ſtrictly taken, may be a fallacious illation in reference unto antecedencie, or conſe-
 quenciez as to conclude from the pofition of the antecedent, unto the
pofitionof the conſequent,or from the remotion of the conſequent to the remotion of the antecedent. This is uſually committed, when in connexed propofitions the termes adhere contingently. This is fre- quent in Oratorie illations , and thus the Phariſces , becauſe he con- verſed with Publicans and finners accuſed the holineſſe of Chriſt. But if this fallacy be largely taken, it is committed in any vitious illa- tiop, offending the rules of good conſequence , and ſoit may be very large, and comprehend all falſe illations againſt the ſetled laws of Lo-
| gick ; butthe moſt uſuall conſequences ate from particulars, from ne-
gatives, and from affirmative concluſions in the ſecond figue, whercin indeed offences are moſt frequent, and their diſcoveries not difficult.

Cnayr. V. Of Credulity and Swpinity.
A Third cauſe of common Errors is the Credulity of men. that is ancafic aſſent, to what is obtruded , ora believing at firſt eare what is delivered by others, this is a weakneſle inthe underſtanding, | without examination afſentivg unto things, which from their natures | and cauſes doe carry no perſwaſion, whereby men often ſwallow falfi. ties for truths , dubiofities for certainties, feſibilities for poſſibilities, and things impoſſible as poſſibilities themſelves. Which though a | weakneſle of the IntelleQ, and moſt diſcoverablein vulgar heads, yet hath it ſometime fallen upon wiſer braines , and great advancers of truth. Thus many wiſe Athenians ſo far forgot their Philoſophy, and the nature of humane produQtion , that they deſcended unto beliefes, | the originall of their Nation was from the Eanth, and had no other be- einning then from the ſcminality and wombe of their great Mother. | Thus is it not without wonder, how thoſe learned Arabicks ſo tamely | delivered up their beliefe unto the. abfurdities of the Alcoran. How the noble Geber, Avicenna and Almanzor, ſhould reſt ſatisfied inthe nature and cauſes of earthquakes, delivered from the-doarine of their Prophet; that is, from the motion of a great Bull, upon whoſe bornes all the earth is poiſed. How their faiths could decline ſo low, asto concedetheir generations in heaven, to be made by the ſmell of aci- tron, or that the felicity of their Paradiſe ſhould conſiſt in a Jubile of conjunion, that is a coition of one a& prolonged unto fitty years. Thus is it almoſt beyond wonder, how the belicfe of reaſonable crea- tures,ſhould ever ſubmit unto Idolatry : and the credulity of thoſe men ſcarce credible, without preſumption of a ſecond fall, who could be- lieve a Deity in the worke of their owne hands. For although in that ancient and diffuſed adoration of Idolls, unto the Prieſts and ſubtiler heads, the worſhip perhaps might be ſymbolicall,and as thoſe Images ſome way related unto their deities, yet was the Idolatry dire and downe-right inthe people, whoſe credulity is illimitable,who may be made believe that any thing is God, and may be made believe there is | no God at all. | And as Credulity is the cauſe of Error, ſo incredulity oftentimes of not enjoying truth, and that not only an obſtinate incredulity, where- by wee will not acknowledge aſſent unto what is reaſonably inferred, but any Academicall reſervation in matters of cafie truth, or rather | [cepticall infidelity againſt the evidence of reaſon and ſenſe. For theſe are conceptions befalling wiſe men, as abſurd as the apprehenſions of fooles, and the credulity of the people which promiſcuouſly ſwallow aty thing, For this is not only derogatory untothe wiſdome of —_ C who

| comparatively exprefſed untothe gumber ofchings whereofour know-
ledge is ignorant z nor will it acquitthe inſatisfaRion of thoſe which quarrell with all things, or diſpute of matters concerning whoſe veri- ties we have conviction from reaſon, or deciſion from the inerrable and requiſite conditions of ſenſe. And therefore if any man ſhall af- firme the earth doth move , and will not belicve with us, it ſtan- deth till, becauſe he hath probable reaſons for it, and I no infallible ſenſe nor reaſon againſt ir, I will not quarrell with his aſſertion : bue if like Zeno be ſhall walke about,and yet deny there is any motion in na- ture, \urely it had been happy he had been born inAntycera,and is only fit ro converſe wich their melancholies,who _—_ conceit thar they are dead, cannot be conviſted into the faciety of the living.
The fourth is a ſupinity or neg R of enquiry,even in matters where- of we doubt, rather beleeving,as we ſay,then going to ſce,or doubting

Had our forefathers ſat downe intheſe reſolutions, or had their curioſities been | ſedentuy , who purſued the knowledge of things through all the cor- |
in ſome part their induſtries have revealed. Certainly the ſweat of their labours was not ſalt unfo them,and they

And though the attempts of ſome bave been preci- | pitous,and their enquiries ſo audacious as to come within command of | the flaming ſwords , and loſt themſclves in attempts above humanity,

ſence or enquiry by reaſon, but live in doubts of things whoſe ſa- Aron is iochelr owne power, which is indeed the inexcuſable of our ignorance, and may perhaps fill up the charge of the laſt day.
For not ing the diRates of reaſon , and negle the cryes of truth, we Ve not onely inthe truſt of our und ings, but in the intention of man it ſelfe, which although more veniall unto ordinary
conſtitutions, and ſuch as arc not framed beyond the capacity of bea- ren notions, yet will it inexcuſably condemne ſome men, who having { received excellent endowments, and ſuchas will accuſe the omiffions | of perfeRion, have yet ſat downe by the way, and fruſtrated thein- tention oftheir habilities. For certainely as ſome men have ſinned, in the principles of humanity, and muſt anſwer , for not being men, ſo | others offend if they be not more 53 Mags exire vitls quam cums virts- | tibus, would commend thoſe, Theſe arc not excuſable without an Ex- cellency. For great conſtitutions , and ſuch as are conftellated unto knowledge, do nothing till they outdoe all ; they come ſhort of them- ſelves if they go not beyond others, and muft not fit downe under the degree of worthies. God expeQRs no luſtre from the minor ſtars, but if the Sun ſhould not illuminate all,ie were a fin in Nature. Y /timmmus be- norum, will not excuſe every man, nor is it ſufficient for all to hold the common levell ; Mens names ſhould not onely diſtionguiſhthem: A man ſhould be ſomething that men are noe, and individuall in ſome- what beſide his proper nature. Thus while it exceeds not the bounds of reaſon, and modefty, we cannot condemne fingularity. Nos nume- rus ſumus, is the motto of the multitude, and for that reaſon are they fooles. For things as = recede from unity , the more they approagh to imperfeRion, and deformity, for they hold their perfeRion in their fimpliciries, and as they neereſt approach unto God.
| Now as there are many great wits to be conderaned, who have neg- |
_—
leRed the increment of Arts, and the ſedulous purſuit of knowledge,
roled the ſtone in vain: which chiefly proceedeth from naturall incapa- | city,and geniall indiſpofition, at leaſt to thoſe particular wayes where- | unto they apply their endeavours. And this is one reaſon why though Univerfities bee full of men, they are oftentimes empty of learning. Why as there are ſome which do much without learning , ſo others but lirtle with it, and few that attaine to any perfeRion in it. For ma-
ſo are there not a few very much to be pittied , whoſe induſtry being ' not attended with naturall parts, they have ſwear to little purpoſe, and |
ny heads that undertake it, were never ſquared nortimbred for it. There are not onely particular men, but whole nations indiſpoſed for learying, whereunto is required not onely education, but a pregnant Miverva and teeming conſtitution. For the wiſdome of God hath di-
vided the Genius of men according to the different affaires of the TY , and varied their inclinations according to the variety of AQi- | C2

For firſt, men hereby impoſe a thraldome on their times, which the | ingenuity of no age ſhould endure, or indeed the preſumption of any ; did ever yet enjoyne. Thus Hippocratesabout 2000, yeare agoe, con- | ceived it no injuſtice , either to examine or refute tne doQtines of his | predeceſſors: Galen the like,and Ariſtotle moſt of any; yet did notany ' of thele conceive themſelves infallible, or ſet downe their diQates as | verities irrefragable; bur when they either deliver their owne inventi- | ons, orrejeted other mens opinions , they proceed with Judgement and Ingenuity, eſtabliſhing their aſſertion, gor onely wich great ſolidi-

There is a certaine liſt of vices committed in all ages , and declaimed againſt by all Authors , which will laſt as long as humane nature, or digeſted into common places may ſerve for any theme, and never be out of date untill Doomes day. Thirdly, the teſtimonies of Ant:quity and ſuch as paſſe oraculouſly amongſt us , were not if wee conſider them alwayes ſo cxaQ , as to examine the docrine they deli. vercd. For ſome, and thoſe the acuteſt of them, have left unto us ma ny things of falficie, controulable, not onely by criticall and colleRive | reaſon, bur common and countrey obſervation.

Other Authors write often dubiouſly , evenin matters wherein is expected a {irift and definitive truth , extenuating their. affirmations, with aint, ferunt, fortaſſe, As Dioſcorides, Galen, Aciſtotle, and ma- ny more.

ry Pretace. The very ſame doth Strabo report of Edorus and Ariſton in a Treatiſe entituled de Milo. Clemens Alexandrinus hath alſoobſer- | ved many examples hereof among the Greekes ; and Plinie ſpeaketh very plainely in his Preface, that conferring his Authors, and compa-
ring their workes together, hee generally found thoſe that weat before
verbatim tranſcribed, by thoſe that followed after, and their originalls never ſo much as mentioned. Even the magnified Virgil hath borrow- ed almoſt all his works : his Eclogues from Theocricus, his Georgicks
from Hefiod and Aratus, his Aneads from Homer , the ſecond Booke
thereof containing the exploitof Sinon and the Trojan horſes, (as Ma- crobius obſcrveth) he hath werbat/m derived from Piſander. Our own | profeſſion is not excuſable herein. Thus Oribafius. Acius and Xgineta | have in a manner tranſcribed Galen. Burt Marcellus Empericus who hath left a famous worke de medicements , hath word for word , tran- ſcribed all Scriboneus Largus, d* compoſitione medicamentorum,and not lefc out his very peroration. And thus may we perccive the Ancients were but men, even like our ſelves. The praQtiſe of tranſcription in our dayes was no monſter in theirs : Plagiaric had not its nativitic with
printing, but began in times when thefts were difficult, and the paucity |
Fourthly, while we ſo cargerly adhear unto Antiquity , and the ac- | counts of elder times, we are to conſider the fabulous condition there- of; and that wee ſhall not deny if wee call to minde the mendacity of Greece, from whom we have received moſt relations, and that a con- fiderable part of Ancicnt times, was by the Grecks themſelves termed #20, that is made up or ſtuffed out with fables ; and ſurely the fabu- lous inclination of thoſe dayes , was greaterthen any fince , which {warmed ſo with fables , and from ſuch ſlender grounds, tooke hyntes for fi tions, poyſoning the world ever after, wherein how far they ex- ceeded,may be exemplified from Palzphatus, in his book of fabulous narrations. That fable of Orpheus, who by the melody of his muſick,
-
made woods and trces to follow him, was raiſed upon a ſlender foun- dation; for there were a crew of mad women, retyred unto a mountain, from whence being pacifyed by his Muſficke, they deſcended with | boughs in their hands, which unto the fabulofitic of thoſe times , pro- ved a ſufficient ground to celebrate unto all poſteritie the Magick of Orpheus harpe, and irs power to attraR the ſenſeleſle trees about it.
That Medea the famous Sorcerefle could renuc youth, and make old

old men young againe , was nothing elfe but that from the know- of fimples ſhee had a receipt ro make white haire black, and | nce old heads into the tinfture of youth agame. The fable of Gerion and Cerberus wich three heads was this: Gerion was of | the City Tricarmia _ —_— heads, and = lace was one of his , which manning into a cave pon purſnit i5 maſters oxen, Hercules perforce drew him out of that place , trom' whence the conccits of thoſe dayes affirmed no lefſe, then that Hercu- | les deſcended into hell, and brought up Cerberus into the habitatioh | | ofthe Living. Uponthe like grounds was raiſed the of Bria- reus, who Gnlog in RN ——_ icsof = | times afhgned him an h - Twas enough to ee rye or ors. failed away with his ſon Icarus, who ſteering his courlſ wiſely, eſcaped, bur his ſon carrying too high a ſaile was drowned. That Niobe | ing over her children was turned intoa ſtone , was nothing elſe but | | chac during her life, ſhe credted overthcir ſepultures,, a marble rombe | ofher owne. When AQcon had undone himſelfe with dogs, and the. | prodigall atrendance of hunting, they made a folemne ſtory how he was devoured by his hounds. And upon the like grounds was raiſed [the —_—_— of Diomedes his horſes. Upon as lender foun- cation was built, the fable of the Minoraure for one Taurus a fervant of Minos begat his miſtreſfe Pafiphae with childe, from whence the infant was named Minotaurus. Now this unto the fabulolitie of thoſe cimes was thought ſufficient to accuſe Pafiphac of Beaftiabtic, or ad- f mirting conjunRion with a Bull and in ſucceeding ages gave a bynte of | depravity unto Domitian to aR the fable into Realiie. Fiftly, we applaude many things delivered by the Ancients , which are in themſelves but ordinarie, and come ſhort of our own [ ons. Thus we uſually extoll, and our Orations cannoteſcape the ſay- ings of the wiſemenof Greece, Noſce teipfune of Thales : Noſce tew- pmof _ : Nihil _ hr ; big rerny. to | ſpeake indiffcremtly,arc r precepts in ity,cartying wich them nothing above the lyne, or beyond the exremporall fententioffty of common conceits with us. Thus we magnifte the RL reputed replyes of wiſdome, whereof many are to be {cen in ws, more in Lycoſthenes, not a few inthe ſecond booke of Macrobins, in the ſalts of Cicero Auguſtus, and the Comicall wits of thoſe times tin moſt whereof there is not much of admiration, and are me chinkes ex- | ceeded, not only inthe replycs of wiſe men, but the paſſapes of focie- tie and daily urbanitics of our times. And thus we extoll cheir adages | or proverbs; and Eraſrous hath taken grent pains to make colleQions of | them, whereof notwithſtanding the greater part will, I beleeve,unto in- different judges be eſteemed no ſuch rarities, and may be paralelled, if not

Laſtly,while we ſodevoutly adhere unto Antiquity in ſome things, we doe not conſider we have deſerted them in ſeverall other, for they indeed have not only been imperfeR,in the conceit of many things, but cither ignorant or erroneous in divers other. They underſtood notthe motion of the cight ſpheare from Weſt to Eaſt, and ſo conceived the longitude of the ſtarres invariable. They conceived the torrid Zone unhabitable, and ſo made fruſtrate the goodlieſt part of the earth. But we now know 'cis very well empeopled , and the habitation thereof eſteemed ſo happy,that ſome have made it the proper ſcat of Paradiſe, and beene ſo farre from judging it unhabitable that they have made it the firſt habitation of all.

Or is only a reſolved proſtration unto Antiquity a powerfull ene- my unto knowledge , but alſo a confident adherence unto any Authority,or refignation of our judgements upon the teſtimony of any Ageor Author whatſoever. For firſt,to ſpeake generally an argument from Authority to wiſer examinations,is but a weaker kinde of proofe, ic being, no other but a topicall probation, and as we ferme it, an inarti- ficiall argument, depending upon a naked affeveration : wherein neither declaring the cauſes, affeRions or adjunds of what we believe, It carri- eth not with it the reaſonable inducements of knowledge;and therefore contra n:gantem principia,Ipſe dixis,or oportes diſcentem credere although
ons, yet are their authorities but temporary, and not to be imbraced be- yond the minority of our intelleQuals, For our adyanced beliefs are not tobe built upon diRates,bur having received the probable inducements of truth , we become cmancipated from teftimoniall engagements,and are toereR uponthe ſurer baſe of reaſon. Secondly, unto reaſonable perpenſions it hath no place in ſome Sciences, ſmall in athers, and ſuf. fereth many reſtriRions, even where it is moſt admitted. Ir isof no ya- lidity in the Mathematicks , eſpecially the mother part thereof Arith- metick and Geometry : For theſe Sciences concluding from dignitics and principles knowne by themſelyes, they receive not ſatisfaRion from probable reaſons, much lefle from bare and peremptory aflevers-

ding from ſetled principles, therein is expected a ſatisfaRtion from {ci- entificiall progreſſions, and ſuch as beget, a ſure and rationall beleete. For it Authority might have made our the aſſertions of Philoſophy, wee might have held , that ſnow was blacke, that the ſea was butthe
| ſweat of the earth, and many of the like abſurdities. Then was Ari-
ſtotle injurious to fall upon Mcliflus, and to rejethe aflertions of A- naxagoras, Anaximander, and Empedocles;and then wete we alſo un- eratetull unto himſelfe, from whom our Junior endeavours embracing many things by his authority, our matureand ſecondary enquiries, are forced to quit thoſe receptions, and to adhere unto the neareſt accounts of reaſon. And although it be not unuſuall , even in Philoſophicall trracates romake enumeration of Authors, yet are there reaſons uſual- ly introduced , and to ingenuous readers doe carry the ſtroake in the perſwaſion. And ſurely it we account ic reaſonable among our ſelves, and not injurious unto rationall Authors, no farther to aber their opini- ons then as they are {ſupported by ſolid reaſon; certainly with more cx- cuſable reſervation may we ſhrink at their bare teſtimonies, whole ar- gument is but precarious and fubſiſts upon the charity of our aſſent- | ments. In Morality, Rhetorick, Law and Hiſtory, there is I conteſle a
frequent ard allowable uſe of teſtimony, and yet herein I perccive,it is
not unlimitable, but admitteth many reſtritions. Thus in Law both
Civill and Divine, that is only eſteemed /egitimum teflimronium , or a
legall teſtimony, which receives comprobation from the mouths of at
leaſt two witneſſes; and that not onely for prevention of calumny, bur
aſſurance againſt miſtake , whereas notwithſtanding the ſolid reaſon
of one man, is as ſufficient as the clamor of a whole Nation;and within
imprejudicate apprehenſions begers as firm a beleecf as the authoritic or | ageregated teſtimony of many hundreds : Forreaſon being the very | root of our natures, and the principles thereof common unto all, what | is againſt the lawes of true reaſon, or the undeceived underſtanding of | any one, if rightly apprehended | muſt be diſclaimed by all Nations, | and rejeed even by mankinde. | Again, a teſtimony is of ſmall validity if deduced from men out of
plaine, or Auſtin himſelfe deny there are Antipodes , though vene- rable Fathers of the Church, and ever to be honoured , will their au- | thorities prove ſufficient to ground a beleete thereon £ whereas not- | withſtanding the ſolid reaſon or confirmed experience of any man, is very approveable in what profeſſion ſoever. So Raymuad Scbund, | a Phyfitian of Tholouze, beſides his learned Dialogues, de nature bu-
21424, hath written a naturall Theologie , demonſtrating therein the Attributes of God, and attempting the like in moſt points of Religion. So Hugo Grocius a Civilian, did write an excellent TraQt in Dutch of the verity of Chuiftian Religion , and hath ſince contracted the ſame |

| | into fix bookes in Latine, wherein moſt rationally delivering them- | ſelves , their works will be embraced by moſt that underſtand them, | and their reaſons enforce belicfe even from prejudicate Readers. Nei- | ther indeed have the authorities of men bin ever ſo awfull, but that by | ſome they have beene rejeed, even intheir owne profeſſions. Thus Ariſtotle affirming the binh of the Infant or time of its geſtation, ex- rendeth ſometimes unto the eleventh month, but Hippocrates averring | that it exceedeth not the tenth. Adrian the Emperour in a ſolemne | proceſle, determined for Ariſtotle; but Juſtinian many yeares after, tooke in with Hippocrates and reverſed the Decree of the other. Thus have Councels not onely condemned private men, but the Decrees | and ARsof one another. So Galen after all his veneration of Hippo- | crates, in ſome things hath fallen from him. Avicen in many from Ga- | len, and others ſucceeding from him: and although the ſingularity of | Paracelſus be intollerable, who ſparing onely Hippocrates , hath re- | viled not onely the Authors , but almoſt all the learning that went be- fore him, yet is it not much leſle injurious unto knowledge obſtinately and inconvincibly to fide with any one: Which humour unhappily | poſſeſſing many men, they have by prejudice withdrawne themſelves | into parties, and contemning the ſoveraignty of truth, ſeditiouſly abet- | ted the private diviſions of error.
Moreover a Teſtimony in points hiſtoricall, and where it is of una- voydable uſe, is of no illaticn in the negative, nor is it of conſequence that Herodotus writing nothing of Rome, there was therefore no ſuch city in his time ; or becauſe Dioſcorides hath made no mention of Ul nicornes horne, there is therefore no ſuch thing in Nature, Indeed. in- tending an accurate enumeration of Medicall materials, the omiſſion hereof affords ſome probability, it was not uſed by the Ancients, bur will not conclude the nonexiſtence thereof. For ſo may we anni- hilate many fimples unknowne to his enquiries, as Senna, Rhabatbe, Bezoar, Ambregris, and divers others. Whereas indeed the reaſon of | man hath no ſuch reſtraint, concluding not onely afficmatively but ne- | oatively , not onely affirming there is no magnitude beyond the laſt heavens, but alſo denying there is any vacuity within them: Although | it be confeſſed the affirmative hath the prerogative illation, and Barba- raengrofleth the powerfull demonſtration. |
Laſtly, the ſtrange and unimaginable relations made by Authors, | may ſufficiently diſcourage our adherence unto Authority, and which | if we beleeve we muſt be apt to [wallow any thing, Thus Baſil will tell ' us,the Serpent went erect like man,and that that beaſt could ſpeake be- |

With no leſſe caution muſt we looke on Ifidor, Biſhop of Sevill, who having left in 2g. bookes, an accurate worke de Originibae, hath tothe Erymologie of words, ſuperadded their received natures, wherein moſt generally hee conſents wich common opinions and Au- chors whica have delivered them.

Cnavy. IX. Of the ſame.
Trier are befide theſe Authors and ſuch as have — moted errors, diverſe other which are in ſome way acceffory, whoſe verities although they do not diredly affert , yet doe they ob- liquely concurre unto their beliefes. In which account are many holy Writers, Preachers, Moraliſts, Rhetoricians, Orators and Poets; for they depending upon inventiori dedice their mediums from all things whatſoever, and playing much upon the ſmile,or illuſtrative argumen- tation, induce their Enthymemes unto the people, —_ up popular conceits,and from traditions unjuſtifiable or really falſe, illuſtrate mat- ters, though not of conſequence, yet undeniable truths. Wherein al- though their intention be ſincere , atd that courſe not much condem- nable, yet are the effects thereof unwarrantable , in 'as much as they ſtrengthen common errors, and confirme as veritable thoſe conceits, which verity cannot allow. TE
Thus have ſome Divines drawne into argument the fable of the Phenix,made uſe of that of the Salamander, Pellican, Baſilisk, and di- vers relations of Pliny , deducing from thence moſt worthy morals, and even uponour Saviour. Now although this be not prejudicial unto wiſer judgements,who are indeed but weakly moved with ſuch kind of argument,yet is it oftentimes occaſion of error unto vulgar heads,who | expe in the fable as equall a truth as in the morall, and conceive that infallible Philoſophy , which is in any ſence delivered by Divinity. | But wiſer diſcerners do well underſtand, that every Art ha irs owne | circle, that the effeRs of things are beſt examined, by ſciences wherein | are delivered their cauſes, that ſtriR and definitive expreſſions, are al- way required in Philoſophy , but a looſe and popular delivery will | ſerve oftentimes in Divinity z as may be obſerved even in holy Scrip- | ture, which often omitteth the exa& account of things , deſcribing them rather to our apprehenſions ', then leaving doubts in vulgar | minds, upon their unknowne and Philoſophicall deſcriptions. Thus it termeth the Sun and the Moone, the two great lights of heaven. Now | if any man ſhall from hence conclude, the Moone is ſecond in magni-- | tude unto the Sun, he muſt excuſe my belicfe ; and I thinke it cannot be taken for hereſie,if I herein rather adhere unto the demonſtration of Ptolomy,then the popular deſcription ofMoſes. Thus is it ſaid, Chron. | 2. 4. That Solomon made a molten fea often cubirs, from brim to brim round in compaſſe, and five cubits the height thereof , and aline | of thirty cubits did compaſle it round about. Now inthis deſcription, the circuraterenceis made juſt treble unto the diameter, that is, 10. to 39, 0r7.t021. But Archimedes demonſtrates in his Cyclometria , ; | E 2 that
i —— hn de LS —_—_
OR te. ee an
chat the proportion ofthe diameter, unto the circumference, is as 7 un- to almoſt 22, which will occaſion a ſenſible difference that is almoſt a cubir. Now if herein I adhere unto Archimedes who ſpeaketh exaR- ly rather then the ſacred Text which ſpeaketh largely , T hope I ſhall not offend Divinity. I am ſure I hall haye reaſon and experience of e- very circle to ſupport me.
Thus Morall Writers, Rhetoricians and Orators makeuſe of feve- rall rclations which will not conſiſt with verity. Ariſtotle in his Echicks takes up the conceir of the Bever , and the diyulſion of his Teſticles. The tradition of the Beare, the Viper , and divers others are frequent amongſt Orators. All which although unto the illiterate, and undil- cerning heaters may ſeema confirmation of their reallitics ; yet is this no reaſonable eſtabliſhment unto others, who will not depend hereon otherwiſethen common Apologues , which being of impoſilble falfi- ties do notwithſtanding include wholeſome moralities, and ſuch as do expiatethe treſpaſſe of their abſurdities.
The Hieroglyphicall doQrine of the Egyptians (which in their four hundred yeares cohabitation, ſome conjeRure they learned from the Hebrewes) hath much advanced many popular conceits , for uſing an Alphabet of things,and not of words, through the Image and pictures thereof, they endeavoured to ſpeak their hidden conceits, in the letters and language of nature ; in purſuit whereof, although in many thingy, they exceeded not their true, and reall apprekenſions, yet in ſome other they cither framing the ſtory, or taking up the tradition , conduceable unto their intentions, obliquely confirmed many falſities, which as au- thentick and conceded truths did after paſſe unto theGreeks,from them unto other Nations, are ſtill retained by ſymbolicall writers, Emble- matiſtes, Heraldes and others, whereof ſome are ſtrialy maintained for truths, as naturally making good their artificiall repreſentations; o- thers ſymbolically intended are literally received , and ſwallowed in the firſt ſenſe, without all guſt of the ſecond. Famous in this doctrine in former ages were Heraiſcus, Cheremon,and Epius,eſpecially-Orus, Apollo, Niliacus, who lived inthe reigne of Theodofius and in Agy- ptian language left two bookes of Hieroglyphicks , tranſlated into Greek by Philippus, in Latine publiſbed by Hoſchelius, and a full col- leQion of all made lately by Pierius.
Painters who are the viſible repreſenters of things, and ſuch as by the learned ſenſe of the eye endeavour to informe the underſtanding, are not inculpable herein , who either deſcribing naturalls as they arc, or ations as they have been , have oftentimes erred in their delineati- ons, which being the bookes that all can read,are fruitfull advincers of theſe conceptions , eſpecially in common and popular apprehenſions, who being unable for farther enquiry muſt reſt inthe text,and letter of

Laſtly, Poets and Poecticall Writers have in this point exceeded | others, leaving unto us the notions of Harpes, Centaurs, Gryphins,and | divers others. Now how ever to make uſe of fitions, Apologues and | fables be not unwarrantable, and the intent of theſe inventions might | point at laudable ends : Yet doe they afford to our junior capacities a | frequent occaſion of error, ſerling impreſſions in our tender metnories, whichour advanced judgements , doe generally negleR to expunge. This way the vaine and idle fitions of the Gentils , did firſt infinuate into the heads of Chriſtians, and thus are they continued even unto our dayes: Our firſt and literary apprehenſions being commonly inſtruted in Authors which handle nothing clſc z wherewith our memories be- ive ſtuffed, our inventions become Pedantick , and cannot avoid their aheons Giving at theſe as atthe higheſt elegancies, which are but the frigidities of wit, and become not the genius of our more manly inge- nuities.

inſtill a beleefe in the minde of man, There is no God at all, and this he ſpecially labours to eſtabliſh in a direR and literall apprehenfion, that is, that there is go ſuch reallity exiſtent, that the neceſſity of his entity dependeth upon ours , and is but a politicall Chymera ; That the naturall cruth of God is an artificiall ereRtion of man,and the Crea- tor himſelfe but a ſubtile invention of the creature. Where hee ſuc- ceeds not thus high,he labours to introduce a ſecendary and deduRive Atheiſme , that although they concede there is a God, yet ſhould they deny his providencezand therefore aſſertions have lown about, that he | intendeth only the care of the ſpecies or common natures, but letteth | looſe the guard of individualls, and fingle eflences therein : That hee
| looks not below the Moone, but hath deſigned the regiment of ſublu- nary affaires unto inferiqur deputations; to promote which apprehenſi- ons or empuzzell their due conceptions , he caſteth in the notions of fate, deſtiny , fortuge, chance and neceſſity ; tearms commonly miſ- conceived by vulgar heads,and their propriety ſometime perverted by the wiſeſt. Whereby extinguiſhing in mindes the compenſation of vertue and vice, the hope and feare of heaven or hell, they comply in | their ations untothe drift of his deluſtons , and live like creatures be- low the capacity of either, .
Now hereby he not only undermineth the Baſe of religion,and de- ſroyeth the principle preambulous unto all beliefe, bur puts upon us | the remoteſt error from truth. For Atheiſme is the greateſt falfiry,and to affirme there is no God the higheſt lic in Nature : and therefore
ſtrily taken, ſome men will ſay his labour is in vaine; For many there are,who cannot concive there was ever any abſolute Atheiſt , or ſuch as could determine there was no God , without all checke from him- ſelfe, or contradiQtion from his own opinions; and therefore thoſe few ſo called by elder times, might be the beſt of Pagans, ſuffering that name rather, in relation tothe gods of the Gentiles, then the truc Cre- atour of all. A conceit that cannot befall his greateſt enemy , or him that would induce the ſame in us, who hath a ſenfible apprehenſion hereof, for he belceveth with trembling. To ſpeake yet more ſtrialy and conformably unto ſome opinions, no creature can wiſh thus much, | norcan the will which hath a power to ranne into velleitics,and wiſhes | of impoſſibilities , have any «#/»4z2 of this. For to deſire there were no God, were plainly tounwiſh their owne being, which muſt needes be anihilated in the ſubſtraRion of that eſſence , which ſubſtantially ſupporteth them, and reftraines them from regreſſion into nothing. Andif as ſome contend, no creature can defire his owne anihilation, that nothing is not appetible, and not to be atall, is warſe then to bee inthe miſerableEondition of ſomething; the divell him ſelfe could not embrace that motion, nor would the enemy of God be freed by ſuch aRedemption. |

But coldly thriving in this deſigne , as being by the pri ciples of haccnley, and the DiRares of that produRion,which pon deny its originall, he fetcheth a wider cirle,and when he cannot make men conceive there is no God atall, hee endeavours to make them be- leeve, there is not one but many; wherein he hath been ſo ſucceſſefull with common heads , that hee hath lead their beliefe thorow all the workes of Nature. |
Now inthis latter attempt, the ſubtilty of his circumyenfion , hath indire&ly obtained the former. For — ko opinion there be
s, may ſcem an exceſlc in Religon, and ſuch as cannot at all confi with Atheiſme, yet doth it diduQively and upon inference include the ſame: for unity is the inſeparable and effentiall attribute of Deities And if there be more then one God,it is no Atheiſmeto ſay there is no God atall. And herein though Socrates onely ſuffered, yet were Plato and Ariſtotle guilry of the fame truth, who demonſtratively under- ſtanding the ſimplicity of perfeRion , and the indiviſible condition of the firſt cauſator, it was not in the power of carth, or Arcopagy of hell to work thery from it. For holding an ApodiRicall knowledge,and aſ- ſured ſciencedt its verity,to perſ[wade their apprehenſions unto a plu- rality ofgods inthe world , were to make Euclide beleevethere were more then one Center ina Circle , or one right Angle ina Triangle, which were indeed a fruitlefſe attempt , and inferreth abſurdities be- yond the evaſion of hell. For though Mechanicke and vulgar heads aſcend not unto fuch comprehenfions , who live not unto halfe the advantage of their principles , yet did they not eſcape the eye of wiſer Minervaes, and ſuch as made good the genealogie of Jupiters braines,who although they had divers ſtyles for God,yet under many appellations acknowledged one divinity:rather conceiviog thereby the evidence or aQs of his power in ſeverall wayes and places, theo a mul- ciplication of Eſſence,or reall diftraRion of unity in any one.
Againe, to render our errors more monſtrous,(and what unto mi- | racleſets forth the patience of God) hee hath endeavored to make the world beleeve,that he was God himſelfe , and fayling of his firſt at- rempt fo be but like the higheſt in heaven, he hath obtained with men to bethe ſame onearth; and hath accordingly afſumed the annexes of | divinity, and the prerogatives of the Creator,drawing into praRiſe the operation of miracles, and the preſcience of things to come. Thus hath he in a ſpecious way wrought cures upon the fick : over the wondrous acts of Prophets, and counterfeired many eg of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: Thus hath he openly contended with God; And to this effe@ his inſolency was not aſhamed to play a ſolemne prize with Moſes, wherein although his performance was very ſpeci- ous,and beyond the apa ras} in» any Die- we , yet was it not ſuch as make good his Omnipotency-. _

he was wholly confounded in the converſion of duſt into lice. AnaR Philoſophy'can ſcarce deny to be above the power of Nature,nor upon a requiſite prediſpoſition beyond the efficacy of the Sun. Wherein not- withſtanding the head of the old Serpent was confeſſedly too weak for Moſeshand.8 the arm of hisMagicians too ſhort for the finger of God,
Thus hath he alſo made men beleeve that he can raiſc the dead,that he hath the key of life and death,and a prerogativeabovethat principle which makes no regreſſion from privations. The Stoicksthat opini- oned the ſoules of wiſe men, dwelt about the Moone, and thole of fooles wandred about the earth, advantaged the conceit of this cffeR, wherein the Epicureans, who held that death was nothing,nor nothing after death,muſt contradiR their principles to be deceived. Nor could the Pythagorian or ſuch as maintained the tranſmigration of ſouls give calic admitrance hereto : for holding chat ſeparated ſoules, ſucceſſively ſupplycd other bodies , they could hardly allow the raifing of ſoules from other worlds, which atthe ſame time,they conceived conjoyned unto bodies in this. More inconſiſtent with theſe opinions, is the error of Chriſtians,who _ the dead doe reſt inthe Lord, doe yet be- leeve they are atthe lure of the divell; that he who is in bonds himſelf commandeth the fetters of the dead , and dwelling inthe bottomleſſe lake,the bleſſed from Abrahams boſome. That can belceve the reſur- retion of Samuel, or that there is any thing but deluſion, in the praiſe
-| of Necromancy and popular conception of Ghoſts.
He hath morcover endeavoured the opinion of Deitie, by the delu- fion of Dreames, and the diſcovery of things to come, in ſleepe above the preſcience of our waked ſenſes. In this expeRation he perſwaded the credulity of elder times to take up their lodging before his temple, in Skinnes of their owne ſacrifices , till his reſorrednedſe had contrived anſwers , whoſe accompliſhments were in his power, or not beyond his preſagement. Which way although it hath pleaſed Almightie God, ſometimes to reveale himſelf, yet was their proceeding very dif- ferent. For the revelations of heaven are conveied by new imprefſi- ons, and the immediate illumination of the ſoule , whereas the decea- ving ſpirit, by concitation of humors , produceth his conceited phan- taſmes,orby compounding the ſpecics alrcady refiding, doth make up words which mentally ſpeake his intergions.
But above all other hee moſt advanced his Deitic in the ſolemne practiſe of Oracles, whercin in ſeverall parts of the world, he publikel profeſſed his divinity; but how ſhort they flew, of that ſpirit, whoſe

Nor ſurely it any truth there were there- in of more then naturall aRivity was his counſell unto Democritus, when for the falling fickneſſe he commended the Maggot in a Goats head, for many things ſecret are very true, ſympathyes and antipathyes | are ſafely authenticke unto us, who ignorant of their cauſes may yet ac- | knowledge their cffeRs.

divell at all and contriveth accordingly, many wayes to conceale or in- |
dubirate his exiſtency : wherein beſide that hee anihilates the bleſſed Angels and ſpirits inthe ranke of his creation, hee begets a ſecurity of himſelfe and a careleſſe eye unto the laſt remunerations. And there- fore hereto he inveigleth,not only the Sadduces and ſuch as retaine un- tothe Church of God, but is alſo content that Epicurus Democritus or any of the heathen ſhould hold the ſame. And to this effeR he maketh men belceve that apparitions, and ſuch as confirme his exiſtence areei- ther deceptions of fight,or melancholy depravements of phancy: Thus when he had not only appeared but ſpake unto Brutus, Caſlius,the Epi- curian was rcady at hand to perſwade him it was but a miſtake in his weary imagination, and that indeed there were noſach realities in na- eure. Thus he endeavours to propagate the unbelicf of witches, whoſe conceſſion infers his coexiſtency, and by this means alſo he advanceth the opinion of totall death,and ſtaggereth the immortality of-the ſoul : for thoſe which deny thereare ſpirics ſubſiſtent without bodies, will with more difficulty affirme the ſeparated exiſtence of their own. Now to induceand bring about theſe falfities he hath laboured to deſtroy the evidence of truth , that is the revealed verity and written ward of God. To which intent he hath obtained with ſometo repu- diatethe books of Moſes, others thoſe of the Prophets,and ſome both to deny the Goſpell and authentick hiſtories of Chriſt,to reje& that of John, and receive that of Judas, todiſallow all and cre another of

But the lopgevity of that peece,which hath ſo long eſcaped the com- mon fate, and the providence of that Spirit which ever waketh over it, may at laſt diſcourage ſuch attempts; and if not, make doubtfull its mortality , at leaft indubitably declare , this is a tone too bigge for Saturnes mouth, and a bit indeed Oblivion cannot ſwallow.
And thus how ſtrangely hee poſleſſeth us with errors may clearely be obſerved, deluding us into contradiRory and inconfiſtent falfities, whileſt he would make us beleeve : That there is no God. That there are many, That he himlclte is God. That he is lefle then Angels or Men. That he is nothing at all. Nor hath hee onely by theſe wiles depraved the conception of the Creator, but with ſuch riddles hath alſo entangled the Nature of our Redeemer. Some denying his hu-
| manity, and that he was one of the Angels, as Ebion , thatthe Father | and Sonne were but one perſon, as Sabellius. That his body was
phantaſticall, as Manes , Baſilides, Priſcillian, Jovinianus; that hee onely paſſed through Mary , as Eutichus and Valentinus. Some deny his Divinity , that he was begotten of humane-principles , and the ſeminall ſonhe of Joſeph, as Carpocras, Symmachus, Photinus. That hee was Seth the ſonne of Abraham, as the Scthians. That hee was leſſe then Angells, as Cherinthus. That hee was inferiour unto Melchiſedech, as Theodotus. That he was not God, but God dwelt in him, as Nicolaus. And ſome embroyled them both. So did they which converted the Trinity into a quaternity,8 affirmed two perſons in Chriſt, as Paulus Samoſarenus,that held he was man without a ſoul, and that the word performed that office in him, as Apollinaris. That he was both Sonne and Father, as Montanus. That Jeſus ſuffered, but Chriſt remained impatible, as Cherinthus. And thus he endeavours
toentangle truths : And when he cannot poſſibly deſtroy its ſubſtance he cunningly confounds its apprehenſions , that from the inconſiſtent and contrary determinations thereof,colleRive impictics,and hopefull concluſion may ariſe, there's no ſuch thing at all.

True it is,and we will not deny it,thar though theſc being naturall produRions from ſecond and ferled cauſes , we need not alway looke upon them as the immediate hands of God , or of his miniſtring Spirits, yet doe they ſometimes admit a reſpeR therein; and even in their naturalls, the indifferencie of their exiſtences contemporiſed unto our ations, admits a farther conſideration,

| Book 1, and Common Errors, Now theſe divinations concerning events. being in his power , to force, contrive, prevent or further, they muſt generally fall out ng formably unto his prediRions. When Graceus was {laine , the ſame day the Chickens refuſed to come out of the coope, And Claudius | Pulcher underwent the like ſucceſſe , when he contemned the Tripu- diary Augurations. They dyed not becauſe the Pullets would not feed, but becauſe the devill foreſaw their death, he contrived that ab- Kinence in them. So was there no naturall ance of the event up- on the figne, but an artificall contrivance of the figne unto the event- An unexpeRed way of deluſion, and whereby he more eaſily led away the incercumſpeRion of their beliefe. Which fallacy he might excel- lently have ated, before the death of Saul, which being in his power to forete]l , was not beyond his ability to foreſhew , and might have contrived ſignes thereof through all the creatures, whictt vifibly con- firmed by the event, had proved authentick unto thoſe times, and ad- vanced the Art ever after. | He deludeth us alſo by Philters, Ligatures, Charmes, ungrounded |
of his owne contriving : which while ſome unwilling to fall directly Magick, imputeunto the power of imagination, or the efficacy of |

upon hidden cauſes, he obtaines a bloody advantage ; for thereby he begets not onely a falſe opinion, but ſuch as leadeth the open way of deſtru- Rion z In maladies admitting naturall reliefes, making men rely on remedies, neither of reall operation in themſelves, nor more then ſeeming efficacy in his concurrence , which whenſoever he pleaſcth | to withdraw, they ſtand naked unto the miſchicfe of their diſeaſes,and | revenge the contempt of the medicines of the earth which God hath created for them. And therefore when neither miracle is expeRed, nor | connexion of cauſe unto effeR from naturall grounds concluded; how- ever it be ſometime ſucceflefull | it cannot be ſafe ta rely on ſuch pra- Riſes, and deſert the knowne and authentick proviſions of God. In which ranke of remedies, if nothing in our knowledge or their proper power be ableto relieve us, wee muſt with patience ſubmit unto that reſtraint, and expeR the will of the Reſtrainer.
Now in theſe effcRs although he ſeeme oft times to imitate, yet doth hee concurre unto their produRtions in a different way from t ſpirit which ſometime in naturall meanes produceth effects above Na- ture; For whether he worketh by cauſes which have relation or none unto the effec, he maketh it out by ſecret and undiſcerned wayes of Nature.

When Julian for his hxmoptyſis or ſpitting of

to conjoyne them by his coeperation. And therefore thoſe ſenſible wayes which {eeme of indifferent natures, are not'idle ceremonies, but may be cauſes by his command , and ariſe unto productions beyond their regular aivities, If Nabaman the Syrian had waſhed in Jordan without the command of the Prophet, I beleceye he had beene cleanſed by them no more then by the waters of Damaſcus. I doubt if any be- | fide Eliſha had caſt in ſalt, the waters of Jericho had not bin made wholeſome thereby. I know that a decoction of wilde gourd or Colo- cynthis, though ſomewhat qualified, will not from every hand be dul- cifted unto aliment by an addition of lower or meale. There was ſome naturall vertue in the plaſter of figs applyed unto Ezechias ; we finde chat gall is very mundificative, and was a proper medicine to cleere the eyes of Tobitz which carrying in themſclves ſome aRion of their owne, they were additionally promoted by that power which can EX-, tend their natures unto the produRion of effeRs beyond their created efficiencies. And thus may he operate alſo from cauſes of no power untotheir viſible effects; for he that hath determined their aRions unto ccrtaine effes,hath not ſo empticd his own but thathe can make them
—_—_
cficuall unto any other.
Againe, although his delufions run higheſt in points of praRiſe , whoſe errors draw on offenſive or penall cnormities , yet doth he al- ſo deale in points of ſpeculation, and things whoſe knowledge termi- nates in themſelves, whoſe cognition although ic ſeemes independent, and therefore its aberration direRly to condemne no man; Yet doth he hereby preparatively diſpoſe us unto errors, and deductively dejeR us into deftruRtive conclufions.
That the Sun, Moone and Stars are liviog creatures , endued with
ſoule and life, ſeemes an innocent error, and a harmelefle digreffion from truth ; yet hereby he confirmed their Idolatry, and made it more plauſibly embraced.

That ſpirits are corporeall, ſeemes at firſt view a conceit derogative | unto himſelfe, and ſuch as he ſhould rather labour to overthrow , yet | hereby he cſtabliſheth the dofrine of Luſtrations, Amulers and | Charmes, as we have declared before. |
Thatthere are two principles of all things, one good, and another | evill; from the one proceeding vertue, love, light, and unity ; from the | other diviſion, diſcord, darknefle and deformity, was the ſpeculation of Pythagoras, Empedocles, and many ancient Philoſophers, and was no more then Oromaſdes and Arimanius of Zoroaſter; yet bereby he / obtained the advantage of Adoration, and as the terrible principle be- came more dreadfull then his Maker, and therefore not willing to let it fall, he furthered the conceit in ſucceeding Ages, and raiſed the faRi- | on of Manes to maintaine it.
Thar the feminine ſex have no generative emiſſion, affording rather | place then principles of conception, was Ariſtotles opinion of old, ' maintained ſtill BY ſome, and will be countenanced by him for ever. | For hereby he diſparageth the fruit of the Virgin, and fruſtrateth the | tundamentall Prophefie,nor can the ſced of the woman then breake the | head of the Serpent.
Naordoth he onely ſport in ſpeculative errors , which are of conſe- quent impieties, but the unquietneſle of his malice hunts after ſimple lapſes,and ſuch whoſe falfities do onely condemneour underſtandings. | Thus if Xenophanes will ſay there is an other world in the Moone, If Heraclitus with his 2dherents will hold the Sunne is no bigger then it appeareth ; If Anaxagoras affirme that Snow is black ; It any other opinionthereare no Antipodes, or that the Stars do fall, ſhall he want herein the applauſe or advocacy of Satan. For maligniog the tranqui- liry of truth, he delightethto trouble its ſtreames, and being a profeſ- ſed enemy unto God, (who is truth ir ſelfe) he promoteth any error as derogatory to his nature, and revengeth himſelfe in every deformity from truth. If therefore at any ciine he ſpeake or pratiſe truth ir is up- on deſigne, and a ſubtile inverſion of the precept of God, to doe good thatevill may come of it. And therefore ſometimes wee meet witch
wholeſome doctrines from hell , Noſſe teipſum : The Motto of Del- phos was a good precept in morality, That a juſt manis beloved of the gods, an uncontroulable verity. Twas a good deed, though not well done, which he wrought by Veſpafian, when by the touch of his foot he reſtored alaine man, and by the ſtroake of his hand another that was blinde , bur the intention hereof drived at his owne adv .for hereby hee not onely confirmed the opinion of his power withthe people, but his integrity with Princes , in whoſe power he knew it lay tooverthrow his Oracles,, and filence the praRiſe of his delu-

But indeed of ſuch a diffuſed nature , and fo large is the Empire of truth, that it hath place within the walles of hell , and the divels them- ſelves are dayly forced to praRiſe itz not only as being true themſelves in a Metaphyſical verity, that is, as haviog theireflence conformable untothe Intelle of their maker, but making uſe of Morall and Logi- call verities , that is, whether inthe conformity of words unto things, or things unto their owne conceptions, they praRiſetruth in common among themſelves. For although without ſpeech they intuitively con- ceive each other , yet doe their apprehenſions proceed through regli- ties, and they conceive cach other by ſpecies, which carry the true and proper notions of things conceived. And ſoalſo in Morall veri- ties,although they deceive us,they lye not unto cach other; as well un- derſtanding that all community is continued by truth , and that of hell cannot conſiſt without it.
To come yet nearer tothe point and draw into a ſharper angle, They doe not onely ſpeake and praQtife truth , but may bee ſaid well- wiſher thereunto,, and in ſome ſenſc doe really defire irs enlargement. For many things which in themſelves are falſe, they doe defire were true Hee cannot but wiſh hee were as he profeſſeth, that hee had the knowledge of future events, were it in his power, the Jewes ſhould be inthe right , and the Meſſias yet to come. Could his defires effeRiir, the opinion of Ariſtotle ſhould be true, the world ſhould have no end, but be as Immorrall as himſelfe. For thereby hee might cvadethe ac- compliſhment of thoſe afflitions, he now but gradually cadureth, for comparatively unto thoſe flames hee is but yet in Balneo , then —_— his 7g»# Rote and terrible fire, which will determine his diſputed ſub- | tiltie,and hazard his immortality.
But to ſpeake ſtrifly, hee is intheſe wiſhes no promoter of verity, bur if conſidered ſome wayes injurious unto truth , for (beſides that if things were true, which now are falſc,it were but an exchange of their natures,and things muſt then be falſe, which now are truc ) the ſctled and determined order of the world would bee perverted , and that courſe of things diſturbed, which ſcemed beſt untothe wiſc contriver. For whileſt they murmure againſt the preſent diſpoſure of things , re- gulating their determined realityes unto their private optations, they reſt not in their eſtabliſhed natures, bur unwiſhing their unalterable ve- rites, doe tacitely defire in them a difformitie from the primitive rule, and the Idea of that minde that formed all things beſt. And thus hee offended truth even in his firſt attempt 4 For not content with his crea- ted nature, and thinking it roolow, to be the higheſt creature of God, ;
he offended the ordainer thereof, not oncly in the attempt ,. but in the wiſh and ſimple volition thereof.

Now beſades authoritie againſt it,there may be many reaſons dedu- ced from their ſeverall differences which ſeeme to overthrow ir. And firſt, a difference is probable in their concretion. For if Cryſtall be a ſtone, (as inthe number thereof it is confefledly received) it is not im- mediatly concreted by the cfficacy of cold , but rather by a Minerall ſpirit, and lapidificall principles of its owne , and therefore while it lay in ſo/a16 principiis , and remained ina fluid body, it was a ſubjeR very unapt for proper conglaceation; for Minerall ſpirits, doc generally re- fiſt and ſcarce ſubmit thereto. So wee obſerve that many waters and ſprings will never freez,and many parts in rivers and lakes, where there arc Minerall eruptions, will ſtill perfiſt without congelation, as we alſo vifbly obſerve, in 4qu« foris, or any Minerall ſoJution, either of Vi- trioll, Alum, Salpeter, Ammoniac,or Tartar; which although ro ſome degree exhaled and placed in cold conſervatories, will Cryſtalliſc and ſhoot inco white _ bodyes; yet is not this a congelation pri- marily effeQed by cold, bur an intrinſecall indurationfrom themſelves, and a retreat into their proper ſolidityes, which were abſorbed by the

coneealed inthe center. : _— aine, the difference of their concretion is not witheut reaſon,
colleible from their diflolution, which being many wayes perform- able in Ice ., is not in the ſame manner effeRed in Cryſtall. Now the cauſes of liquation are contrary to thoſe of concretion,and as the atoms and indivifible parcels are united , ſo are they in anoppoſite way dil- joyned. That which is concreted by exficcation or expreſſion of humi- dity,wil be reſolved by humeRation,as carth,dirt,and clay;that which is coagulated by a fiery ficcity , will ſuffer colliquation from an aque- ous humidity, as ſalt and ſugar , which are cafily difſoluble in water, but not without difficulty in oyle , and well reQified ſpirits of wine. That which is concreated by cold , will diflolye by a moiſt heat , if ir confiſt of watery parts, as Gums, Arabick, Tragacanth, Ammoniac, and others, in an ayric heat or oyle, as all refinous bodies, Turpentine, Pirch,and Frankincenſe,in both as gummy refinous bodies, Maſticke, Camphire, and Storax; in neither , as neutralls and bodies anomalous hereto, as Bdellium, Myrrhe and others. Some by a violent dry heat, 25 mettalls, which although corrodible by waters, yet will they not ſuffer a liquation from the powerfulleſt heat, communicable anto that clement. Some will diflolve by this heat although their ingredients be carthy, as glaſſe , whoſe materialls are fine ſand , and the aſhes of Chali or Fearne , and ſo will ſalt runne with fire, although it bee con- created by heat, and this way alone may bee efteaed a liquation in
cing it by Arte, into a ſubtile powder , by which way and a vitre- ous commixture, glaſſes are ſometime made hereof,and it becomes the chiefefſt ground for artificiall and faRitious gemmes; but the ſame way of ſolution is common alſo unto many ſtones,and not only Berylls and Cornelians, but flints and pebbles, are ſubjeR unto fuſion , and will runne like glaſſe in fire, ,
But Ice will diſſolve in aty way of heat, for it will diffolyve with fire, it will colliquate in water, or warme oyle; nor doth it only ſubmit to an auall heat , but not endure the potentiall calidity of many wa- ters; for it will preſently diſſolve in 4qu« forts fp. of vitrioll , ſalt or tartar, nor will it long continue its fixation in ſpirits of wine , as may be obſerved in Ice injected therein.
Againe, the concretion of Ice will not endure a dry attrition with- out liquation , for if it be rubbed long with a cloth jt melteth , but Cryftall will calefy unto electricity , that is a power to attraR ſtrawes or light bodies, and convert the needle freely placed 5 which is a de- clarement of very different parts, wherein wee ſhall not at preſent

inlarge, as having diſcourſed at full concerning ſuch bodies in the
Chap.of EleAricks. : They are differenced by ſupernatation or floating upon water, for
| Chryftall will finke in water as carrying in its owne bulke a greater
ponderoſity, then the ſpace in any water it doth occupy,and will there- fore only ſwim in molten mettall,aud Quickfilyer.But Ice will ſwimin water of what thinneſle ſoever ; and though it finke in oyle, will float in ſpirits of wine or 4que vite. And therefore it may ſwim in water,not only as being water it ſe]fe, and inits proper place , but perhaps as weighing no more then the water it poſſeſſeth. And therefore as it will not finke unto the bottome, ſo will it neither float above like ligh- ter bodies, but being neare, or inequality of weight , lye ſuperficially or almoſt horizontally unto it. And therefore alſo an Ice or congela-
tion of ſalt or ſugar, although it deſcend not unto the bottome, yet will
it abate, and decline below the ſurface inthin water, but very ſen(ibly in ſpirits of wine. For Ice although it ſcemeth as tranſparent and com- paR as Chryſtall, yet is it ſhort in either , for its atoms are not concre- ted into continuity, which doth diminiſh its tranſlucencyj it is alſo full of ſpumes and bubbles,which may abate its gravity. And therefore waters frozen in pans, and open glaſſes, after their diſſolution do com- monly leave a froth, and ſpume uponthem.
They are diſtinguiſht into ſubſtance of parts and the accidents there- of, that is in colour and figure; for Ice is afimilary body, and homoge- neous concretion, whoſe materiall is properly water, and but acciden- tally exceeding the ſimplicity of that clement ; but the body of Cry-
ſtall is mixed, its ivgredients many, and ſenfibly containeth choſe prin- |
Ciples into which mixt bodies are reduced ; for beſide the ſpirit and mercuriall principle , it containeth a ſulphur or inflamable part, and that inno ſmall quantity; for upon collifion with ſteele, it will actually ſend forth its ſparkes not much inferior unto a flint. Now ſuch bodies only ſtrike fire as have a ſulphur or ignitible parts within them. For as we elſewhere declare , theſe ſcintillations are notthe accenſion of the ayrc, upon the collifion of two hard bodies, but rather the inflamable — —_ from the bodies collided. For diamonds, mar- , heliotropes, though hard bodics, will not ſtrike fir
nor one ſtcele eafily withanother,nor a flint eaſily with a ſteele,if they both be wer, for then the ſparkes are quenched in their ervption. |
It containeth alſo a ſalt, and that in ſome plenty which may occafi-
| on its fragility, as is alſo obſervable in corall. This bythe art of Chy- |
miſtry is ſeparable unto the operations whereof it is lyable, with other concretions, as calcination, reverberation, ſublimation, diftiltation : And inthe preparation of Cryſtall, Paracelſus hath made airule for that of Gemms, as he declarethin his firſt deproperationibuc.

menftruums are made for its emolition , whereby it may receive the | tinQture of mincrals,and ſo reſemble Gemms,as Boetius hath declared in the diſtillation of Urine, ſpixits of wine, and ine, and is not onely triturable, apd reduceable into powder, by contrition, but will ſubfiſt in a violent fire, and endure a vitrification: Wherby are teſtified its earthy and fixed parts. For vitrification is the laſt worke of fire, and when that arriveth, humidity is exhaled, for powdered glaſſeemirs no fume or exhalation althongh it bee laid upon a red hot iron. And cherefore when ſome commend the powder of burnt glaſſe againſt the ſtone, they fall not under my comprehenſion , who cannot conceive how a body ſhould be farther burned , which hath already paſſed the extreameſt teſte of fire.
As for colour although cryftall in his pellucide body ſeems to have none at all, yet in its reduQion into powder, it hath a vaile and ſhadow of blew, and in its courſer peeces, is of a ſadder hue, then the powder of Venice glaſle, which complexion it will maintaine although ir long endure the fire; which notwithſtanding needs not move us unto won- der, for vitrified and pellucide bodyes , are of a clearer complexion in cheir continuities , then intheir powders and Atomicall divifions. So Stibiums or glaſſe of Antimony, appears fomewhart red inglaſſe, but in ics powder yellow;ſo painted glafſe of a ſanguine red will not aſcend in powder above 2 murrey.
As for the figure of cryſtall (which is very ſtrange, and forced Plinie to the deſpaire of reſolution ) it is for the moſt part hexagonall or fix cornerd , being built upon a confuſed matter from whence as it were from a root angular figures ariſe,as inthe Amethiſts and Baſaltes, which regular figuration hath made ſome opinion, it hath not its de-
but rather from a ſeminall root, and formative principle of its owne, e- venas we obſerve in ſeyerall other conctetions. So the ſtones which arc ſometime found inthe gall of a man , are moſt triangular, and py- ramidall, although the figure of that part ſeems notto cooperatethere- to. Sothe ,&ferieor Lapis Stellaris, hath on itthe figure of a Starre, and ſo Laps Indaicus, that famous remedy for the ſtone, hath circular lines in length all downe its body, and equidiftant, as though they had been turned by Art. Sothat we call a Fayrie ſtone, and is often found ingravell pits us, being of an hemiſphericall figure, hath five double lines arifing txomthe center of its bafis , which if no accretion
| diſtra them doe commonly concur and meet iathe pole thereof. The
| figures are regular in many other ſtones, as in the Belemnites, Lapis 4n- guinus, Corny Ammonis, and divers beſide, as by thoſe which havenot the experience hereof may be obſcrved in their figures expreſſed by | Mineralogiſtes. But Ice teceiveth its figure according unto the ſur-

And therefore Ariſtotle in his Meteors concludeth that haile which is not round is congealed nearer the carth, for that which falleth | trom an high, is by the length of its journey corraded,and deſcendeth therefore in aleſſer magnitude, but greater rotundity unto us.

The waters are hid as with a ſtone, and the face of the deep is frozen. | They have contrary qualities elemental, and uſes medicinall ; for Ice is cold and moyſt, of the quality of water : But Cryſtall is cold and dry, according to the condition of earth, the uſe of Ice is condem- | ned by moſt Phyfitians; that of Chryſtall commended by many. For although Dioſcorides and Galen, have left no mention thereof z yet hath Mathiolus, Agricola,and many other commended it in diſenteries and fluxes; all tor the encreaſe of milke,moft Chymiſtes for the ſtone, | and ſome as Brafſayolus and Boctius , as anantidote againſt poyſon : Which occult and ſpecificall operations, are not expeRible from Ice ; for being but water _— , it can never make good ſuch qualities, nor will it reaſonably admit of ſecret proprieties, which arc the affeRi- ons of formes, and compoſitions at diſtance from their clements. Having thus declared what Chryſtall is not, it may afford ſome ſa- tisfaRion to manifeſt what it is. . To deliver therefore what with the judgement of approved Authors, and beſt reaſon conſiſteth, It is a mi- nerall body in the difference of ſtones, and reduced by ſome unto that ſubdiviſion , which comprehendeth gemmes ; tranſparent and reſcm- bling glaſſe or Ice, made of a lentous colament of earth, drawne from the moſt pure and limpid juyce thereof , owing unto the coldneſſe of the earth ſome concurrence or coadjuvancy , bur not its immediate determination and efficiency , which are wrought by the hand of its concretive ſpirit, the ſeeds of petrification and Gorgon within ir ſelfe , as we may conceive in ſtones and gems, as Diamonds, Beryls.,Saphires and the like,whoſe generation we cannot with fatisfation confine un- tothe remote aRivity ofthe Sun, or the common operation of cold. neſſe

Theſecond and moſt common ground is from the name Cryſtals, whereby in Greeke, both Ice and Cryſtall are expreſſed, which many not duly conſidering, have from their community of name, conceived a community of nature, and what was aſcribed nnto the one, not unfitly appliable unto the other. But this is a fallacy of Xquivocation,from a ſociety inname inferring an.Identity in nature. By this fallacy was ke deceived that drank 4qua forts for ſtrong water:By this are they delu. ded, who conceive ſperma Cats ( which is a bituminous ſuperfluirance onthe Sea) to be the ſpawne of the Whale, Or take ſavgess dracons, | (which is the gurame of a tree } to be the blood of a Dragon.

And ſuch aMagnetical vertue we conceive to be in the Globe of the earth; whereby as unto ics natu- rall points and proper terms it diſpoſeth it ſelf unto the poles, being ſo framed,conſtiruted & ordered unto theſe points,that thoſe parts which are now at the poles, would not naturally abide under the Aquator,nor Green-land remain in the place of Magellanica; and if the whole earth were violently removed , yet would it not forgoe its primirive points, nor pitch in the Eft or Weſt, but return unto its polary poſirion again. For though by compaQeſle or gravi'y it may acquire the loweft place, and become the center of the univerſe, yer that it makes good that point, not varying at all by the accefſionof bodyes upon, or ſe- ceſſion thereof, from its ſurface perturbing the cqulliianica of cicher Hemiſpheare (whereby the altitude of the ſtarres might vary) or that ie ſtritly maintaines the north and ſoutherne points, that neither upon the motions of the heavens, ayre and winds withour, large eruptions ind divifionof parts within, its polar paits ſhould never incline or vecre
cannot ſo well be ſalved from gravity as a magneticall verticity. This is probably that foundation the wiſdome of the Creator hath laid unto the carth,and in this ſenſe we may more nearly apprehend,and ſenſibly make out the expreſſions of holy Scripture, as that of Pſ.93.1. Firme-
| wit orbem terre qui non commovebitur , he hath made the round world | ſoſure that it cannot be moved : as when it is ſaid by Job, Extends 4- | quilonem ſaper vacuo, &rc, Hee ſtretcheth forth the North upon the | empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. And this is the moſt
probable an{wer untothat great queſtion, Job ;8. whereupon are the
| foundations of the carth faſtened , or who laid the corner ſtone there-
of 2 Had they been acquainted with this principle, Anaxagoras, So- crates and Democritus had better made our the ground of this ſtabili- ry : Xenophanes had not been faine to ſay it had no botrome,, and
| hales Milefius to make it-{wim in water. Now whether the carth ſtand ſtill , or moveth circularly , we may concede this Magneticall
ſtability : For although it move, in that converſion the poles and cen- ter may ſtill remaine the ſame, as is conceived in the Magneticall bo- dies of heaven, eſpecially Jupiter and the Sunne z which according to Galileus, Kepler, and Fabricius, are obſerved to have Dineticall moti- ons and certaine revolutions about their proper centers z and though theone in abour the ſpace of ten dayes, the other in lefſethen one, ac- compliſhthis revolution, yet do they obſerve a conſtant habirudeunto their poles and firme themſelves thereon intheir gyration.
Nor is the vigour of this great body included only in is {elfe;or cir- cumferenced by its ſurface , but diffuſed at indererminate'Giftances through the ayre , water and bodyes circumjacent , exciting and im- pregnating magneticall bodyes within it ſurface or without it,and per-

For theſe effluxions penerrate all bodyes, and like the ſpecics of viſible objeRts are ever ready inthe mediun, and lay hold on all bodyes proportionate or capable of their ations thole bo- dyes likewiſe being of a congenerous nature doe readily receive the impreſſions of their motor z and if not fettered by their gravity , con- ferme themſelves to fituations,wherein they beſt unite unto their Ani- mator. And this will ſufficiently appeare from the obſervations that areto follow, which can no better way bee made out then this wee ſpeake of the magneticall vigour of the carth. Now whether theſe et- | Auviums do flye by ſtreated Aromes and winding particles a3 Renatav des Certes conceaveth, or glide by ſtreames attraed from either pole ' and hemiſpheare of the earth unto the Aquator, as Sir Kenelme Dig- | by excellently declarcth, it takes not away this vertue of the but more diſtinRly ſets downe the geſts and progrefle thereof, and arc corceits of eminent uſe to ſalve magneticall phenomena's. And as in Aſtronomy thoſe hypotheſes though never ſo ſtrange are beſt cſtee- med which beſt do ſalve apparencies, ſo ſurely in Philoſophy thoſe principles(though ſeeming monſtrous may with advantage be embra- ced; which beſt confirme experiment , and afford the readieſt reaſon of obſervation, And truly the dorine of effluxions, their penetrating natures, their inviſible -- by and inſuſpeRed effeRs, are very confide- rable; for beſides this magneticall one of the earth, ſeverall effuſions there may be from divers other bodies, which invifibly aRtheir parts at any time, and perhaps t h any medium, a part of Philoſophy but yer in diſcovery, and will I feare provethe laſt leafe to be turned: over inthe w_ of Nature. fy by | Firſt, therefore it is evidently true and confirmable by every experi- ment, that ſteele and good Iron never excited by the Loadſtone, diſ- cover in themſelves a verticity ; that is, a direQive or polary faculty,

' the North the South, and the like decline cach other,as the North the
North. Now on this fide of the A&quator, that extreme which is next
the earth is animated unto the Nortn,and the contrary unto the South,
{orhat in Coition it applyes it ſelfe quite oppoſitely, the coition or at-

ſpeake according unto common ule, yer alike if we conceave the virtue

at the North againe.
This polarity Iron refrigeration upon extremity and in defeR of a Loadſtone might ſerve to invigorate and touch a needle any where ; and this, allowing variation, is alſo the trueſt way at any ſeaſon to dil. cover the North or South and ſurely farre more certaine then what is afhcmed of the graines and circles in trees, or the figure in the roote of Ferne. Forif we cre a red hot wire untill it coole, then hang it u with wax and untwiſted ſilke , where the lower end and that whic cooled next the earth doth reſt, that is the Northerne point z and this we affirme will ſtill be true, whether it be cooled inthe ayre orcxtin- guiſhed in water,oyle of vitrioll, Aqua fortis, or Quickſilver.

is alſo evidenced in culinary-utenfils and Irons that often feele the force of fire, as tongs, fireſhovels, prongs and Andirons , all which acquire a magneticall and polary condition, and being ſuſpended,convert their lower extremes unto the North, with the ſame attraRting the Southerne point of the Needle, For cafier experiment if wee place a Needle tou-

| ched atthe foote of tongues or andirons, it will obvert or turne aſide
its lyllie or North point,and conforme its cuſpis or South extreme un- tothe andiron, The like verticity though more obſcurely is alſo con- traced by brickes and tiles, as wee have made triall in ſome taken out ofthe backs of chimneys. Now to contrat this DireRian,there needs not a totall ignition, nor is it neceſſary the Irons ſhould bee red hot all over. For if a wire be heated onely at one end, according as thet end is cooled upward or downeward, it reſpeQively acquires a verticity , as wehave declared before in wires totally candent. Nor is it abſolutely requiſitethey ſhould be exaRtly cooled perpendicularly, or ſtridly lye inthe meridian, for whether they be refrigerated inclinatorily or ſome- what Xquinoxially, that is toward the Eiſterne or Welterne points chough in a leſſer degree, they diſcover ſome verticity.
Nor is this onely true in Irons but inthe Loadftone it ſelfe ; for if a Loadſtone be made red hot inthe fire it amits the magneticall vigour ic had before in it ſelfe, and acquires another from the earth in its refri- gerationy for that part which cooleth towardthe carth will acquire the reſpeR of the North, and attraR the Southerne point or cuſpis of the Need!c. The experiment hereof we made ina Loadſtone of a parallel- logram or long ſquare figure, whercin only inverting the extremes as it came out of the fire , wee altered the poles or faces thereof at pleaſure.
It is alſo true what is delivered of the DireRtion and coition of Irons that they contraR a verticity by long and continued poſition , that is, not onely being placed from North to South, and lying in the meridi- an, but reſpeRing the Zenith and perpendicular unto the center of the earth, as is moſt manifeſt in barres of windowes, caſements , hindges and the like, for if we preſent the Needle unto their lower extremes, it wheeles about it and turnes its Southerne pointunto them. The ſame condition in long time doe bricks contract which are placed in walls, and therefore it may be a fallible way to finde out the meridian by pla- cing the Needle ona wall for ſome bricks therein which by a long and continued poſition, are often magnetically enabled to diſtract the po- larity of the Needle.
Laſtly , Irons doe manifeſt a verticity not only upon refrigeration and conſtant ſituation, but(what is wonderfull and advanceth the mag- neticall hypotheſis) they cvidence the ſame by meer poſition accor- ding as they are itverted and their extreams diſpoſed reſpeRively un- tothe earth.

Now if an iron be touched before, it varycth not in | this manner, for then ir admits not this magneticall impreſſion, as being |
| already informed by the Loadftone and polarily determined by its
reaRion. | : And trom theſe grounds may we beſt determine why the Northern pole of the Loadſtone attraQeth a greater weight then the Southerne | onthis fide the Equator , why the ſtone is beſt preſerved ina naturall and polary ſituation; and why as Gilbertus obſcrveth, it reſpeReth chat | pole out of the carth which it regarded in its minercall bed and ſubter. rancous poſition. = It is likewiſe true and wonderfull what is delivered of the Inclina- tion or Declination of the Loadſtone; that is, the deſcent of the needle below the plaine of the Horizon : for long needles which
Q- rouſly excited , incline and bend downeward , depreſling the Noh extreame below the Horizon z that is the Notth on this, the South on the other fide of the Equator, and at the very Lyne or middle | circle of the Earth ſtand parallell, and deficeth neither. And | this is evidenced notonly from obſervations of the needle in ſeve- rall parts of the earth, but ſundry experiments in any part thereof, as in
rs - dhe ballanced inthe ayre.; for excited by a vigorous LoadſtofleKwill tomewhart depreſle its anima- tredextreme, and intereſt the horizontall circumference. It is alſo-ma- nifeſt ina ncedle pierced through a globe of Cork ſocut away and pa- red by degrees that it will ſwim under water, yet finke not unto the bottome, which may be well effected ; for if the corke bee a thought coo light to finke under the ſurface , the body of the water may be at- tenuated with ſpirits of wine if too heavy, it may be incraſſated with ſalt and if by chance too nauch be added,it may againe be thinned by a proportionable addition of freih water : if then the needle be taken out, aRively touched and put iD againe, it will deprefle and bow down its northerne head toward the bottome , and advance its ſoutherne ex- tremity toward the brim. This way invented by Gilbertus may feem of difficulty z the ſame with leflc labour may be obſerved in a needlcd ſphere of corke equally contiguous unto the ſurface of the watergfor if the needle be notexaRly equiponderant , that end which is a thaughe t00 light, if touched becommeth cven, that needle alſo which will but juſt ſwim under water if forcibly touched will ſinke deeper,and ſome-

For if they be powerfully excited 8&equally let fall, they commonly fink down and break the water at that extream wherat they were { jonally excited, & by this way it is conceived there may be ſome fraud inthe weighing of precious commodities,and ſuch as carry a value in quarter grains,by placing a powerfull Loadſtone above or below,according as we intend to depres or elevateone extrem.
Now if theſe magneticallemiſhons bee only qualities, and che gra- vity of bqdyes incline them only unto the carth;ſurely that which mo- veth other bodyes to deſcent carryeth not the ſtroak in this, but rather the magneticall alliciency of the carth, unto which alacrity it applyeth it ſelfe, and inthe very ſame way unto the whole earth, as it doth unto a fiogle Loadſtone : for if an untouched needle be at a diſtance ſuſpen- ded over a Loadftone , it will not hang parallel , but decline at the north extreme,and at that part will firſt ſalute its Diceor. Again,what is alſo wonderfull, this inclination is not invariable, for as it is obſcr- ved juſt under the line the needle lyeth paralle] withthe Horizon, but ſayling north or ſouth it beginneth to incline, and increaſeth according as it approacheth unto either pole , and would at laſt endeavour to c- rec it ſelfe;and this is no more then what it doth upon the Loadſtone, and that more plainly vponthe Terrellaor ſphericall magnet geogra- phically ſer out with circles of the Globe. For at the Aquatar there- of the needle will ſtand reangularly, but approaching northward to- ward the tropick it will regard the ſtone obliquely; 8 when it attaineth the pole dire&ly,and if its bulk be no impediment, crc it ſclfand ſtand perpendicularly thereon, And therefore upon ſti obſervation of this :nclination in ſeverall latitudes & due records preferved,inſtruments are made whereby without the help of Sun or Star,the latitude of the place may be diſcovered;and yet it appears the obſervations of men have not as yet been ſo juſt 8 equallas is deſirable,for of thoſe tables of declina- tion which I have peruſcd,there are net any two that punQually agree, chough ſom have been thoght exalycalculated,eſpecially that which Ridley received fro Mr. Bries in our time GeometryProfeſlor in Oxford.
Ic is alſo probable whar is delivered concerning the variation of the compaſle that is the cauſe and ground thereof, for the manner as being confirmed by obſervation we ſhall not atall diſpute. The variation of the compaſle is an Arch of the Horizon intercepted between the true and magneticall meridian, or more plainly,a deflexion and ſiding Eaſt and Weſt fromthe true meridian. The true meridian is a major circle paſſing through the poles of the world, and the Zenith or Vertex of a- ny place, exaQly dividing the Eaſt from the Weſt. Now on this lyne
the needle exaAtly lycth not , but diverts and yaricth its point, that is the

Now becauſe where the greater continents are joyned , the aRion| | and efluenceis alſo greater, therefore thoſe needles do ſuffer the grea-| * reft variation which are in Countreys which moſt do feel that Action, | | And therefore hath Rome far lefle variation then London; for on the

And this is the generall and great cauſe of variation. But if in certaine creekes and valleys the e prove irregular, and vary beyond expeRance, it may be imputed unto ſome vigorous part of the| + carth , or Magneticall eminence not far diſtant.

And whereas it is contended that this verticity was not unknowne unto Salomon , in whom is preſumed a univerſality of knowledge, it will as forcibly fol- low he knew the Arte of Typography, powder and gunnes, or had the Philoſophers ſtone, yet ſent unto Ophir for gold. Ir is not to be deny- ed, that befide his politicall wiſdome z his knowledge in Philoſophic was very large, and perhaps from his workes therein, the ancient Phi- loſophers eſpecially Ariſtotle , who had the aſſiſtance of Alexanders acquirements, collected great obſervables, yet if he knew the uſe of the Compaſle, his ſhips were ſurely very flow , that made a three yeares voyape from Eziongeber in the red Sea unto Ophir , which is upp {cd to be Taprobana or Malaca inthe Indies, not many moneths ſayle,

And as the knowledge of its verticity is not ſo old as ſome con- ceive, ſo is it more ancient then moſt beleeve ; nor had its diſcovery with gunnes, printing,or as many thinke, ſome yeers before the diſco- very of America ;, for it was not unknowne unto Petrus Peregrinus 3

Laſtly, It is likewiſe true what ſome have delivered of Crocus mmar- 31, that 1s, ſteele corroded with vineger, ſulphur, or otherwiſe,and af- fer reverberated by fire. For the Loadftone will not at all atrra& it, nor will it adhere, bur lye therein like ſand. This is to be underſtood of Crocus martis well reverberated, and intoa violet colour : for common chalybs prepararas, or corroded and powdered ſteele, the Loadſtone attracts like ordinary filings of iron,and many times moſt of thatwhich paſſeth for Crocus warts. So that this way may ſerve as.a teſt of its preparation,after which it becommeth a very good medicine in fluxes.

For inthe Southerne coaſt eitherof America or Africa, the Southerne point defli:Rts and varieth toward the land, as beivg diſpoſed and ſpirited that way by the meri- dionall and proper Hemiſphere. And therefore on that fide of the
earth the varying point is beſt accounted by the South. And therefore
Jlſothe writings of fome,and Maps of others, arc to be enquired, that make the needle decline unto the Eaſt twelve degrees at Capo Feio, and fixe at the ſtraits of Magellan, accounting hereby one point for another, and preferring the North in the liberties and province of the South. But certainely falſe if is what is commonly affirmed and belceved, that Garlick doth hinder the attraRion of the Loadſtone; which is not- withſtanding delivered by grave and worthy Writers, by Pliny, Soli- nus, Ptolomy, Plutarch, Albertus, Mathiolus, Rucus, Langius, and many more. AneffeR as ſtrange as that of Homers Moly, and the Garlick the gods beſtowed upon Ulyſſes. But that it is evidently falſe, many experiments declare. For an Iron wire heated red hot and quenched inthe juyce of Garlick, doth notwithſtanding contra a verticity from the carth, ahd attrateth the Southerne point of the Needle. Ifalſothe tooth af a Loadſtone be covered or ſtuck in Gar- lik, it will notwithſtanding attraR and animate any Needles excited and fixed in Garlick untill « intoruſt, doe yet retaine their at- traive and polary reſpes.

ancient and moderne , that an Adamant or Diamond prevents or fu- ſpends the attrationof che Load(tone, as is in open termes delivered by Pliny. Adam as diffidet cum Magnete Lapide ut juxia poſutues ferr is non patiatur abſftirahi, aut fi admetrs magnes epprehenderit, rapuat atque aafe- rat. For it a Diamond be placed betweene a needle and a Loadſtone, there will nevertheleſlſe enſue a Coition even over the body of the Di- amond : and ancafie marter it is to touch or excite a needle through a Diamond, by placing it atthe cooth of a Loadſtone, and therefore the relation is falſe, or oureſtimation of theſe gems untrue z nor are they Diamonds which carry that name amongſt us.
It is not ſuddenly to be received what Paracelſus in his booke De ge- ner atione reruw affirmeth, that if a Loadſtone be annoimed with Mer- curiall oyle, or onely put into Quickſilver, it omitteth ics atrraRion for ever. For we have found that Loadſtones and touched needles which have laid long time in Quickſilver have not amirted their attraion , and we alſo finde that red hot needles or wites extinguiſhed in quick- liver, do yetacquire a verticity according tothe Laws of poſicion in extinion, Of greater repugnancy unto reaſon is that which he deli- vers concerning its graduation, that heated in fire & often extinguiſhed in oyle of Mars or Iron, it acquires an ability to extra or draw forth a naile faſtened in a wall ; for, as we have declared before, the vigor of the Loadſtone is deſtroyed by fire , nor will it be reimpregnated by any other Magnete then the carth.
True it is, and we ſhall not deny, that beſides fire ſome other wayes there are of its deſtruRion, as Age, Ruſte, and what is leaſt dreamt on 20 unnaturall or contrary ſituation ; for being impolarily adjoyned un- to a more vigorous Loadſtone,it will in a ſhort time exchange it poles, or being kept in undue poſition, that is , not lying on the mctridian or with its pales inverted , it receaves in longer time impaite in aRiviry exchange of faces, and is more powerfully preſerved by ſite then by the duſt of ſtecle. But the ſudden and ſureſt way is fire, as we have dc- clared before: that is, fire not onely actuall but potcariall; the one ſurely and ſuddenly, the other ſlowly and imperfectly; the one chan- ivg, the other deſtroying the figure. For if diſtilled Vinegar or Aqua- attis be powred upon the powder of Loadſtone, the {ubliding pow- der dryed, retaines ſome magneticall vertue, and will be attrated by the Loadſtone: but if the menſtruum or diſlolvent be evaporated to a conGſtence, and afterward doth ſhoote into Icycles or cryſtalls, the Loadſtone hath no power upon them, and if in a full diflolution of ſteele a ſeparation ot parts be made by precipitation or exhalation , the exſiccated powder hath loſt its wings and aſcends not unto the Load- ſtone. And though a Loadſtone fired do preſently omit its proper ver- tue, and according to the poſition in cooling contracts a new verticity from the carth, yet ifthe ſame be laid a while in Aqua fortis or other

For of the glafle we uſe, the pureſt is made of the fineſt ſand and the aſhes of Chali or Glafleworte, and the courſer or ſort of the aſhes of brake or other plants. Befide, vi- rrification is the Iaft or urmoſt fuſton of a body vitrifiable, and is per- formed by a ſtrong and violent fire, which keepsthe melted glaſſe red

Another kinde of verticity, is that which Angelus doce mibi jus, a- «, Michael Sundevogis, in a Trac de ſalpbwre, diſcovereth in Vege- tables , from ſticks let fall or deprefled under water, which equally framed and permitted unto themſelves, will aſcend at the upper end,or

Ic is alſo wondrous ſtrange and untrue what Lzlius Biſciola repor- teth, that if untoten ounces of Loadſtone one of Iron be added, it en- creaſeth not unto eleven, but weighs ten ounces ſtill ? a relation inexcu- ſable in thetitle of his worke, Hore ſabſecive , or leaſurcable howres: the examination being as ready as the relation, and the falſity tryed as cafily as delivered : nor is it to be omitted what is taken up by Czſiug Bernardus a late Mineralogift, and originally confirmed by Porta, that needles touched with a Diamond contra a verticity, even as they doe with a Loadſtone , which will not conſiſt with experimew.', And therefore, as Gilbertus obſerveth, he might be deceived, in touching ſuchgeedles with Diamonds, which had a vetticity before, as we have
| ——— | —C—
decffted moſt needles to have, and ſo had he touched them with gold or filver, he might have concluded a magneticall vertue therein.
In the ſame forme may we place Fracaſtorius his attraction of (il- ver, Philoſtratus his Panturbes, Apollodorus, and Beda his relation of
the Loadſtone that attraRed onely in the night : but moſt inexcuſable is Franciſcus Rueus,a man of our own profeſſion, who in his Diſcourſe of gemmes mentioned in the Apocalyps, undertakes a Chapter of the Loadſtone; wherein ſubſtantially and upon experiment he ſcarce deli- vereth any thing , making enumeration of its traditionall qualities, whereof he ſcemeth to beleeve many, and ſome of thoſe above, convi- Red by experience, he is fain to ſalve as impoſtures of the Devill. But Boetius de Boot Phyſician unto Rodulphus the ſecond , hath recom- penced this defet ; and in his Trac, de lepidibus + gemmy, (peakes very materially hereof, and his diſcourſe is conſonant unco experience and reaſon.

The 0- ther the tombe of Mahomet and bodies ſuſpended in the aire.

ganto Arche the Temple of Arſinoe in Alexandria with Load ſtone, that ſo her ſtatne might be ſuſpended in the ayre to the amazement of the bcholders; and to lead on our credulity, herein confirmation may be drawne from Hiſtory and Writers of good authority : ſois it re- ported by Ruffinus , that inthe Temple of Serapis there was an iron chariot ſuſpended by Loadſtones in the ayre , which ſtones removed, the chariot fell and daſhed into peeces. The like doth Beda report of | Bellerophons horſe which framed of iron, and placed betweene two Loadſtones with winges expanſed, hung pendulous in the ayre,
The verity of theſe ſtories we ſhall not turther diſpute their poſſibi- lity, we may in ſome way determine; if we conceive,what no man will deny , that bodies ſuſpended in the aice have this ſuſpenfion from one
or many Loadſtones placed both above and below it, or elſe by ene or many placed only above it. Likewiſe the body to be ſuſpended in | reſpe& of the Loadſtone above , is placed firſt at a pendulous diſtance in the medium,or elſe attracted unto that ſite by the vigor ofthe Load- ſtone; and ſo we firſt afficm that poſſible it is a body may be ſuſpended between two Loadſtones ; that is, it being ſo equally attraRted unto both that it defermineth it ſelfe unto neither : but ſurely this poſition will beof no duration; for if the ayre be agitated or the body waved either way , it omits the equilibration and diſpoſeth it ſelfe unto the neareſt attraRer, Again,it is not impoſſible(though hardly feiſtble) by a ſingle Loadſtone to ſuſpend an iron in theayre, the iron being artifi- cially placed.,and at a diſtance guided toward the ſtone,untill it find the newtrall point wherein its gravity juſt equalls the magneticall quality, | the one exaRly extolling as much as the other deprefſeth; and thus
muſt be interpreted Fracaſtorins, And laſtly, impoſſible it is that if an iron reft upon the ground , and a Loadſtone be placed over it, ir ſhould ever ſo ariſe as to hang in the way or medium ; for that vigor | which at a diſtance is able to overcome the reſiſtance of its gravity [ and to lift it up from the earth , will as it approacheth nearer be ſtill more able to attraR it, and it will never xemaine inthe middle that could not abide inthe extreams;andthus is to be underſtood Gilbertus. Now the way of Baptiſi« Porta that by a thred faſtencth a needleto a table, and then ſo guides and orders the ſame, that by the attraction of the Loadſtone it abideth in the aire, infcingeth not this reaſon; for this is a violent retention, and if the thred be looſened , the needle aſcends and adheres untothe AttraRor.
The third conſideration concerneth relations Medicall, wherein what ever effects are delivered , they are derived from its minerall and ferre- ous condition , or elſe magneticall operation. Ulato the ferreous and minerall quality pertaineth what Dioſcorides an ancient Writer and Souldier under Anthony and Cleopatra, affirmeth , that halfea dram
of Loadſtone given with honey and water , proves a purgative medi- Cine,

cine, and evacuateth grofle humors , but this is a quality of great in- certainty, for omitting the vehicle of water and honey , which is of a laxative power it ſelfe , the powder of ſome Loadſtones in this doſe doth rather conſtipate and binde , then purge and looſen the belly. And if ſometimes it caufe any laxity it is probably in the ſame way F with iron and ſtecle unprepared, which will diſturbe ſome bodies, and | worke by purge and vomit. And therefore , what is delivered in a booke aſcribed unto Galen that it isa good medicine in dropfies , and evacuates the waters of perſons ſo affeed: Ic may I confeſle by ficcity and aſtriQion afford a confirmation unto parts relaxed, and ſuch as be hydropically diſpoſed, and by theſe qualities it may be uſefull in Her- nias or Ruptures , and for theſe it is commended by Ztius , Agineta and Oribafius, who only affirme that it containes the vertue of Hzma- tites, and being burnt was ſometimes yvended for it. To this minerall condition belongeth what is delivered by ſome, that wounds which are made with weapons excited by the Loadſtone, contract a maligni- ty, and become of more difficult cure; which nevertheleſle is not to be found inthe incifion of Chyrurgions with knives and lancets touched, | which leave no ſuch effec behindethem. Hicherto muſt we alſo referre that affirmative which ſayes the Loadſtone is poyſon, and therefore in the liſts of poyſons we finde it in many Authors z but this our experi- ence cannot confirme , and the praRice of the King of Zeilan clearl contraditerh , whoas Garcias 46 Herts , Phyfitian unto the Spani Viceroy delivercth, hath all his meat ſerved up in diſhes of Loadſtone, and conceives thereby he preſerveth the vigor of youth. | Burſurely from a magneticall aRivity muſt be made out what is let | fall by Zrius,that a Loadſtone held inthe hand of one that is podagri- call doth either cure or give great caſe inthe gout. Or what Marcellus Empericus affirmeth, that as anamulet it alſo cureth the head-ach, wb are but additions unto its proper nature, and hopefull enlargements of its allowed attraRion z for perceiving its ſecret power to draw unto it ſelfe en, 0 ns bodies, men have invented a new attraQion to draw out the dolorand paine of any part.

Now this kinde of pratice Libavius, Gilbertus, and lately Swickardus in his Ars Magnetica, condemne, as vaine, and altogether unuſefull , and their reaſon is, becauſe a Load- ſtone in powder hath no attraQive power for in that forme it omits his polary reſpeRs, and looſeth thoſe parts which are the rule of its attra- Aion : wherein to ſpeake —_— if experiment hath not de- 0

For ifthe powder of a rich veine be in a reaſonable quan- tity preſented toward the Needle freely placed , it will not appeate to be void of all aRivity, but will be able to ſtir it 5 nor hath it only a po- wer to move the Needle inpowder and by itſelfe, but this will it alſo doe, if inco ed and mixed withplaiſters, as we have made triall in the E rum de Minis, with halfe an ounce of the ng dram of Lions , for applying the magdaleon or roale unto the Needle ic would both ſtir and ateraR it 3 not equally in all parts, but more As mg in ſome, according unto the mine of che ſtone more plentifully diſperſed in the maſſe.

count we comprehend effects derived and fathered upon hidden quali- ties,ſpecifical forms, Antipathies and Sympathies, whereof from recei- | ved grounds of Art,no reaſons are derived. Herein relations are ſtrange | and numerous , men being apt in all ages to multiply wonders, and | Philoſophers dealing with admirable bodies as Hiſtorians have done | with excellent men, upon the ſtrength of their great atchievements, aſ- | cribing a&s unto them not only falſe , but impoſſible , and exceeding eruch as much in their relations, as they have others in their aRions. Hereof we ſhall briefly mention ſome delivered by Authors of good eftcem , whereby we may diſcover the fabulous inventions of = the credulous ſupunity of others, and the great diſſervice unto truth by | both; mulciplying obſcurities in nature, and authorifing hidden quali- ics that are falſe , whereas wiſe men are aſhamed there are ſo many true. And firſt, Dioſcorides puts upon it a ſhrewd quality,and ſuch as men are apt enough to experiment, and therewith diſcovers the incontinen- cie of a wife by placing the Loadſtone under her pillow; forthen ſhee | will not be able to remaine in bed with her husband. The ſame he al- | ſo makes a helpe unto theevery ; for theeves ſaith he , having a de- figne upon a houſe , doe make a fire at the foure corners thereot, and caſt therein the fragments of Loadſtane, whence ariſcth a fume that ſo | diſturbeth the inhabitants , that thef forſake the houſe and leave itto the ſpoyl of the robbers. This relation how ridiculous ſoever,hath Al- bertus taken up aboye a thouſand years after, &:Marbodeus the French- | man hath continued it the ſame in Latine verſe, which with the notes of PiRorious is currant unto our dayes. As ſtrange muſt be the Litho- mancy or divination from this ſtone, whereby as Tzetzes in his Chy- liads delivers, Helenus the Prophet foretold the deſtrution of Troy; and the Magick thereof, not ſafely to be beleeved, what was delivered by Orpheus, that ſprinkled with water it will upon a queſtion emit a voyce not much unlike an Infant. But ſurely the Loadſtone of Lau- rentius Guaſcus the Phyfitian is never to be matched , wherewith as Cardane delivercth, whatſoever needles or bodies were touched, the -wounds and punRures made thereby, were never felt at all. And yet as ſtrange a vertue is that which is delivered by ſome that 2 Loadſtone preſerved in the ſalt of a Remora, acquires a powerto attraR gold out otthe deepeſt Wells.

her rejeRing ir. The conceit is excellent, and if the effe& would low ſomwhat divine, whereby we might communicate like ſpirits, and conferre on carth with Menippus in the Moone, which is pretend- cd from the ſympathy of two needles touched with the ſame Load- ſone, and placed inthe center of two Abecedary circles, or rings with letters deſcribed round about themzone friend keeping one, & another the other, and agrecing upon an houre wherein theywil communicate. For then ſaith tradition, at what diſtance of place ſoever , when one needle ſhall be removed unto any letter ; the other by a wonderfull Sympathy will move unto the ſame. But herein I conteſle my experi- ence can finde no truth z for having expreſly framed ewo circles of wood, and according tothe number of the Latine letters divided each into twenty three parts , placing therein two ſtiles or needles compo- ſed of the ſame ſteele , touched with the ſame Loadſtone, and at the ſame point : yet of theſe two,whenſoever I removed the one, although
| but at the diſtance of halfe a ſpanne, the other would ſtand like Her-
cules pillars, and if the earth ſtand ſtill , have ſurely nomotion at all, Now as it is not poſſible that any body ſhould have no boundaryes, or 25 we terme it Sphere of its aQivity, {o is it improbable it ſhould effeR chat at diſtance, which nearer hand it cannot at all performe.
Againe, the conceit is ill _—_— and one effcR inferred, whereas indeed the contrary will enſue. For if the removing of one of the needls from A to B ſhould have any aRion or influence on the other,it would not intice it from A to B butrepell it from Ato Z : for needles excited by the ſame point of the ſtone, doe nat attraR, but avoyd each other,even as thele aiſo do,jwhen their invigorated extreams approach unto one another,
Laſtly, were this conceit affuredly true, yet were it not a concluſion at every diſtance to be tryed by every head: yet being no ordinary or Almanack bufinefſe, but a probleme Mathematicall , to finde out the difference of houres in different places ; nor doe the wiſeſt exacly ſatisfie themfelves in all. For the houres of ſeverall places anticipate each other , according unto their Longitudes , which are not exa&ly diſcovered of every place, and therefore the triall hereof at a conſider- able intervall,is beſt performed at the diſtance of the Antzci, that is, ſuch habitations as have the ſame Meridian and equall parallell,on dif- ferent ſides of the Equator, or more plainly have the ſame Longitude, and the ſame Latitude unto the South, which wee have in the North. For unto ſuch Situgtions it is noone and midnight at the very ſame time. | And thereforethe Sympathic of theſe needles is much of the ſame mould, with that intelligence which is pretended from the fleſh of one body tranſmuted by incifion info another. For if the Arte of Talia-
tranſmutation

cranſmutation be made from one mans body into another, as if apiece of fleſh be exchanged from rhe biciptall muſcle of cither partics arme, and about them both , an Alphabet circumſcribed ; upon a time ap- |
inted as ſome conceptions affirme , they may communicate at what diſtance ſoever. For if the one ſhall prick himſelf in A, the other at the ſame time will have a ſenſe thereof in the ſame part z and upon in- ſpection of his ar me, perceive what letters the other points out in his owne; which is a way of intelligence very ſtrange, and would requite the Arte of Pythagoras, who could read a reverſe inthe Moone.
Now this Magneticall conceit how ſtrange ſoever , might have ſome originall in reaſon; far men obſerving no ſolid body,whatſoever did interrupt its aRion, might be induced to beleeve no diſtance would rerminate the ſame, 8 moſt conceiving it pointed unto the pole of hea- ven, might alſo opinion that nothing between could reſtrain it. Who- ſoever was the Author , the Xolus that blew it about , was Famianus Strada,that clegant Jeſuit in his Rhetoricall prolutions, who choſe our
of this ſubie& to expreſle the ſtile of Lucretius. But neither =<.” 4 Porta,de furtivis literarum n0tis; Trithemius inhis Steganography, Si - nus in his Cryptography, or Nuncius izan/matze written of late yeers

contradid not the rule of its operations.
As for unguentum Armariam, Called alſo Megneticum , it belongs not to this diſcourſe, it neither having the Loadſtone for its ingredi- ent , nor any one of its aRions: but ſuppoſeth other principles,as com- mon and univerſall ſpirits, which convey the aRion of the remedy un- to the part, and conjoynes the vertue of bodies far disjoyned. But per- haps the cures it doth, are not worth ſo mighty principles, it com- | monly healing but ſimple wounds , and ſuch as mundified and kept cleane, doe need no other hand then that of Nature, and the Balſam of the proper part. Ulnto which effeR,there being fields of Medicines ſut- ficient, it may bee a hazardous curioficie to relic on this 4 and becauſe men ſay the effeR doth generally follow,it might be worth the cxperi- ment totry, if the ſame will not enſue upon the ſame method of cure, by ordinary Balſams,or common vulnerary plaſters.

{J Aving thus ſpoake of the Loadſtone and bodies magneticall , I ſhall in the next place deliver ſomewhat of EleAricall, and ſuch as may ſceme to have attraRion like the other, and hereof wee ſhall alſo deliver what particularly ſpoken or not generally knowne is mani- feſtly or probabletrue , what generally belceved is alſo falſe or dubi- ous. Now by EleQricall bodies, 1 underſtand not ſuch as are Me- tallicall mentioned by Pliny , and the Ancients, for their Eletrum was a mixture made of gold , withthe addition of the fifth part of (il- ver, a ſubſtance now as unknowne, as true Aurichalcum, or Coriathi- an braſſe, and ſet downe among things loſt by Pancirollus. Nor by Eledtrick bodies do I conceive ſuch onely as take up ſhavings, ſtrawes, and light bodies, in which number the Ancients onely placed Jet and | Amber ; but ſuch as conveniently placed unto their obje&s atrraR all bodies palpable whatſoever.I {ay, conveniently placed,that is,in regard | of the objeR, that it be not too ponderous,, or any way affixcd inre- gard of the Agent, that it be not foule or ſullied, but wiped, rubbed, and excitated in regard of both, that they be conveniently diſtant, and no impediment interpoſed. ſay all bodies palpable,thereby excluding fire, whichindeed it will not attraR, nor yet draw through it , for fice conſumes its efluxions by which it ſhould attraR. |
Now although in this ranke but ewo were commonly mentioned by the Ancients, Gilberfus diſcovereth many more, as Diamonds, Sa- phyres, Carbuncles, Iris, Opalls, Amethiſtes, Berill, Chryſtall, Bri- | ſtoll Rones, Sulphur, Maſtick, hard Wax, hard Rofin, Arſenic, Sal | gemme, roch Alume, common Glaſle, Stibium, or glafſe of Antimo- | ny ; untotheſe Cabeus addeth white Wax, Gum Elemi, Gum Guaic), | Pix Hiſpanics, and Gypſum. And unto theſe wee adde gum Anime, Benjamin, Talcum, Chyna diſhes, Sandaraca, Turpentine, Styrax Li- quida, and Carannadryed into a hard confiſtence. And the ſame at- tration wee finde not onely in ſimple bodies , but ſuch as are much compounded, as the Oxicreceum plaſter, and obſcurely that ad Herni-

ver a ſufficient power to ſtirre the needle ſetled freely upon a wel poin- ted pinne, and {oas the EleQrick may be applyed unto it without all diſadvantage.
But Sion of theſe EleQricks we obſerveto be very different, Reſinous or unRuons bodies, and ſuch as will flame,attraR moſt vigo- rouſly and moſt thereof without fication, as Anime, Benjamin and | moſt powerfully good hard wax , which will convert the needle al- | ' moſt as aQively as the loadſtone ; and wee beleeve that all or moſt of chis ſubſtance if reduced to hardnefle tralucency or cleerenefſe, would have ſome attraQivequality ; but juyces concrete, or gums eaſily dil- ſolving in water,draw not at all, as Aloe, Opium, uis Draconis, Lacca, Galbanum, Sagapenum. Many ſtones alſo precious and vulgar, although terſe and ſmooth have not this power attraRive z as Emeralds, Pcarle, Jaſpis, Corneleans, Agathe, Heliotropes, Marble, Alablaſter, Touchſtone, Flint and Bezoar. Glaſſe attraRs but weakely though cleerc, ſome {lick ſtones and thick glaſſes indifferently: Arſenic but weakely, ſo likewiſe glafſe of Antimony, but Crocus Mctallorum | not at all. Saltes generally but weakely, as Sal Gemma, Alum and alſo | Talke ; nor very diſcoverably by any frication : but it gently warmed at the fire, and wiped with a dry cloth, they will better diſcover their  Eledricities,
No metcall attraQts, nor any concretian Animall wee know , al- though polite and ſmoothe z as wee have made triall in Elkes hooves, | Hawkes talons, the ſword of a Sword fiſh, Tortoyſe ſhels, Sea-horſe and Elephants teeth, in bones, in Harts horne, and what is uſually con- ceived Unicornes horne, no wood though never ſo hard and poliſhed, although out of ſome Electricks proceed, as Ebony, Box, Ligoum vitz, Cedar, &c. And although Jet and Amber be reckoned among Bitumens, yet neither doe we finde Aſphaltus, that is, Bitumen of Ju- dea, nor Seacole,nor Camphire, nor Mummia to attraR, although we have tried in large and poliſhed pieces. Now this attraQion have wee tried in ſtrawes and paleous bodies, in needles of Iron equilibrated, powders of wood and Iron, in gold and filyer foliate , and not onely in ſolid but fluent and liquid bodies, as oyles made both by expreſſion and diſtillation, in water, in ſpirits of wine, vitrioll and Aqua tortis.
But how this attraRtion is made is not ſo cafily determined z that | tis performed by effluviuens is plaine and granted by moſt , for Ele- ricks will not commonly attraR, except they grow hot or be perſpi- cable. Forif they be foule and obnubilated, it hinders their effluxion, nor it they be covered though but with Linnen or Sarſenet, or it a bo- dy be interpoſed, for that intercepts the cfluvium. If alſo a powerfull and broad Ele&rick of wax or Anime be held over fic powder, the | Atomes or ſmall particles will aſcend moſt numerouſly unto it 3 and if | the EleQrick be held unto the light , ic may be obſerved that —_—

thereot will flye, and be as it were diſcharged from the EleGtrick to the | diſtance ſometime of two or three inches, which motion is performed
by the breath of the effluvium ifluing wita agility; for as the EleQick cooleth, the projeRion of the Atomes ceaſeth.
The manner hereof Cabeus wittily attempteth , affirming that this effluyium attenuateth and impelleth the neighbour ayre , which retur- ning home in a gyration, carrieth wich it the obvious bodies unto the Elerick, andthis he labours to confirme by experiments, for if the ſtrawes be raiſed by a vigorous elerick, they Lo appeare to wave and turne in their aſcents ; if likewiſe the EleQrick be broad and the ſtrawes light and chaffy, and held at a reaſonable diſtance, they will not ariſe unto the middle, but rather adhere toward the verge' or bor- ders thereof. And laſtly, if many ſtrawes be laid together and a nimble EleRrick approach, they will not all ariſe unto ir, but ſome will com- monly ſtart aſide and be whirled a reaſonable diſtance from it. Now that the ayre impelled returnes unto its place ina gyration or whirling, is evident from the Atomes or moates in the Sua. For when the Sunne ' | ſoenters a hole or window , that by its illumination the Aromes or moates become perceptible, if then by our breath the ayre bec gently impelled, it may be perceived that they will circularly returne, and in a gyration unto their places againe.
Another way of their attraRion is alſo delivered, that it is made by a tenuous emanation or continued effluvium, which after ſome diſtance retraeth into it ſelfe, as is obſervable in drops of ſyrups, oyle and ſe- | minall viſcoſities, which ſpun at length retire into their former dimen- { fions. Now theſe efluviums advancing from the body of the Ele- rick, in their returne doe carry back the bodies which they have laid hold within the ſpheare or circle of their continuities , and theſe they do not onely attrat but with their viſcous armes, hold faſt a good | while after. And if any ſhall wonder why theſe effluviums iſſuing forth | impell and protrude not the ſtraw before they can bring it back, it is
becauſe Efluvium paſſing out in a ſmaller thred and more enlengrhe- ned filament, it ſtirreth not the bodies 1 ſed but returning unto its originall it falls into a cloſer ſubſtance, and carrieth them back unto it ſelte. And this way of attraRtion is beſt received,embraced by Sir Ke- nelme Digby in his excellent Treaty of bodies, allowed by Des Cartes in his principles of Philoſophy, as farre as concerneth fat and refinous bodies, and with exception of glaſſe, whoſe attraQion he alſo deriveth from the receſle of its efluxion. And this in ſome manner the words of Gilbertus will beare. Zffluvia ils tenwiera concipiunt & amplettuntur corpora, quibus uniantur, &r Elefris tanquam extenſis brachits & ad fon- zem , propinquitate invaleſcemibus effluviis , deducantur. And it the R—_ were true that the earth were an EleQrick body, and the ayre

attraQion and by this <ffluxion that bodies tended tothe earth, and could not remaine abouc it. Our other diſcourſe of EleQricks concerneth a penerall Opinion touching Jet and Amber, that they attraG all light bodies » except O- mor Baſil, and ſuch as bedipped in oyle or oyled , and this is ed as high as Theophraſtus : but Scaliger acquitteth him; And had this bin his aſſertion, Pliny would probably have taken it up, who herein ſtands out, and delivereth no more but what is vulgarly known. But Plutarch ſpeakes poſitively in his Syrmpoſiacks, that Amber at- traceth all bodies, excepting Bafil and oyled ſubſtances. With Plu- tarch conſent many Authors both ancientand moderne , but the moſt inexcuſable are Lemnius, and Rueus, whereof the one delivering the nature of minerals, mentioned in Scripture the infallible fountaine of | truth , confirmeth their yertues with erroneous traditions z the other undertaking the occult and hidden miracles of Nature, accepteth this for one , and endeavoureth toalledge a reaſon of that which is more | then occult, that is not exiſtent. Now herein, omitting the Authority of others , as the docrine of | experiment hath informed us we firſt affirme, that Ainber attracts not | Baſil, is wholly repugnant untotruth , for ifthe leaves thereof or dry- ed ſtalkes be ſtripped into ſmall ſtrawes,they ariſe unto Amber, Wax, and other EleQties no otherwiſethen thoſe of Wheate or Rye; nor is there any peculiar fatneſſe or ſingular viſcofity in that plant that might cauſe adheſion and ſo preyent its aſcenſion. But that Jet'and A attraR not ſtrawes oyled, is in part true and falſe, for if the ſtrawes be much wet or drenched in oyle,true it is that Amber draweth them not, |
they are placed, ſo that they cannot riſe unto the Attracor, and this is true not onely if they be ſoaked in oyle , but ſpirits of wine or water. Bur if we ſpeake of ſtrawes or feſtucous diviſions lightly drawen over with oyle, and ſo that it cauſeth no adheſion, or if we conceive an an- tipathy betweene oyle and Amber, the doQrine is not true; for Am- ber will attraRt ftrawes thus oyled,it will attraR or convert the Needls of Dials made either of Brafſe or Iron, although they be much oyled , for intheſe Needls conſiſting free upon their center there can be no adhefion , it will likewiſe attraR oyle it ſelfe, and if it approacheth un- toadrop thereof , it becommeth conicall and ariſeth up unto it, for oyle taketh not away his attraQion, although it be rubbed over it. For if youtoucha piece of wax already excitated with common oyle, it will notwithſtanding attraR, chough not ſo vigorouſly as before. But it you moyſten the {ame with any chymicall oyle, water or fpirits of wine, of onely breath upon it, it quite omits its AttraRion, for cither ies efluetices cannot get through or will not mingle with thoſe ſub- |

And many bodics will coagulate upon commixture whoſe ſeparated natures promiſe no concretion, Thus upon a ſolution of Tinne by Aqua fortis, there will enſue a cea- eulacion, like that of whites of cgges.

ompendiouſly 0 wndry other common Tenents, concerning Minerall and Terre- | v 0u5 rg examined, prove either falſe or poomeng | 1. A Nd firſt we hear it in every mans mouth.,and in Au- |
Alton we reade it, That a Diamond, which is pr arr of | ſtones, and not _ unto ſtcele, Emery, or any thing, but its own powder, is yet made ſoft, or broke by the bloud of a Goat 3 Thus much is affirmed by Pliny, Solinus, Albertus, Cyprian, Auſtin, Ifi- dore , and many Chriſtian Writers, alluding herein unto the heart of | man, and the precious bloud of our Saviour, who was typified indeed by the Goat that was laine, and the ſcape Goat in the wilderneſle; and at the effuſion of whoſe bloud, not onely the hard hearts of his enc- mies relented , but the ſtony rocks and vaile of the Temple was ſhat- tered. Bur this I perceive is caſter affirmed then proved. For Lapida- ries, and ſuch as profeſſc the art of cutting this ſtone,doe generally de- oy it, and they that ſcem to countenance it , have in their deliveries ſo qualified it, tharlittle from thence of moment can be inferred for it. {For firſt, the holy Fathers, without a further enquiry did take it for granted, and reſted upon the authority of the firſt deliverers. As for Albertus, he promiſeth this effeR but conditionally, that is not except the Goat drinke wine , and be fed with Siler montanum, petroſelinam, and ſuch hearbes as are conceived of power to breake the ſtore in the bladder. But the words of Pliny from whom moſt likely the reſt at | firſt derived it, it ſtritly conſidered, doe rather overthrow, then any way advantage this cffet. His words are theſe: Hircins rumpitar ſan geine , nec alter quam recenti, calideque micerats, & fic quoque maltis ithibus, twnc etiam preterguam eximias incudes malleoſque ferrevs fran- gens, Thatis, it is broken with Goats blood, bur not except it bee treſh and warme , and that not without many blows , and then alſo it w1ll breake the beſt anvills and hammers of iron. And anſwerable hereto, is the aſſertion of Ifidore and Solinus. By which account, a Diamond ſteeped in Goats bloud, rather encreaſeth in hardneſle, then acquireth any ſoftneſle by the infuſion; for the beſt we have are com- minuible without it, and are ſofar from breaking hammers, that they ſubmit unto piſtillation, and re fiſt not an ordinary peſtle.
Upon this conceit aroſe, perhapsthe diſcovery of another , that is, that the bloud of a Goat , was ſovereigne for the ſtone, as it ſtands | commended by many good Writers, and brings up the compoitionio the Lichontripticke powder of Nicolaus,or rather becauſe it was found an excellent medicine for the ſtone , and its ability commended by ſome to diſſolve the hardeſt thereof; it might be conceived by amplity- ing apprehenſions, to be able tro breaka Diamond, and ſo it cameto be

ordered that the Goat ſhould be fed with ſaxifragous herbes, and ſuch 25 are conceived of power to breake the ſtone. However it were as theeffſeR is falſe in the one, ſois it ſurely very doubttull in the other, Foralthough inwardly received it may be very diuretick , and expulſe the ſtone in the kidnyes;yet how it ſhould diſſolve or breake that inthe bladder, will require a further diſputc,and perhaps would be more rea- ſonably tryed by a warme injeRion thercof , then as it is commonly uſed. Wherein notwithſtanding, we ſhould rather relic upon the urine in  Caſtlings bladder, a reſolution of Crabs eyes, orthe ſecond diſtil- lation of urine, as Helmont hath commended y or rather , if any ſuch might be found a ChylifaRory menſtruum or digeſtive preparation drawne from ſpecies or individualls, whale &omacks peculiarly diſfolve lapideous bodies.
2. That glaſſe s poyſes, according unto common conceit, I know not how to grant not only trom the innocency of irs ingredients, that is fine ſand , and the aſhes ofglafſe-wort or fearne, which in themſelves are harmeleſſe and uſefull : or becauſe I finde it by many commended for the ſtone, but alſo from experience, as having given unto dogs above a dram thereof, ſubtilly powdered in butter or paſte, without any viſible diſturbance. And thetryall thereof we the rather did make in chat animall, becauſe Grevinus in his Treaty of poyſons,affirmeth that dogges are inevitably deſtroyed thereby.
The conceit is ſurely grounded wm the viſible miſchicfe of glaſſe eroſſely or courſely powdered;for that indeed is mortally noxions,and effeQually uſed by ſome to deſtroy myce and rats , for that by reaſon of its acuteneſle and augularity, commonly excoriates the parts through which it paſſeth, and ſollicits them unto a continuall expulfi- on. Whereuponthere enſues fearfull ſymptomes , not much unlike thoſe which attend the aRion of poyſon. From whence notwith- ſtanding , we cannot with propriety impoſe upon it that name , either by occult or elementary quality; which he that concedeth will much enlarge the catalogue or liſtes of poyſons z for many things , neither deletcrious by ſubſtance or quality,are yet deſtruRive by figure, or — aQivity. ve _ _ —_ by ſame ac-

So a ſponge is miſchievous, not in it ſelfe, for inits powder it is harmleſſe, but becauſe being recci- ved into the ſtomack it ſwelleth , and occafioning a continuall diſteo- fion, indnceth at laſt a ſtrangulation. So pins, ncedls, eares of Ryc or Barley, may be poyſon. So Daniel deftroyed the Dragon by a com- poſition of three things, whereof neither was poyſon alone , nor pro-

3+ That Gold inwardly taken,and chateither in ſubſtance, infuſion, decoQion or extinRion is a ſpeciall cordiall of great efficacy , in ſun- dry medicall uſes,although a praRice much nfed is alſo much queſtio- ned, and by no man determined beyond diſpute. There are hereof I
perceive two _— inions carne +> CU Sying ing it, and robably beyond its delerts; ot y vilitying ir,and perh. below irs demerits. Some affirming it is a nadie in = ny diſcaſes, others averring that ſo uſed it is effeQuallin none, and in this number are very eminent Phyſicians, Eraſtus, Duretus, Rondele- tius, Braſſavolus, and many other;who beſide the ſtrigments and ſudo- rous adheſions from mens hands , acknowledge that nothing procee- deth from gold in the uſuall decoction thereof. Now the capitall rea- ſon thatled men unto this opinion wastheir obſervation of the inſepe- rable nature of gold, it beiog excluded inthe ſame quantity as it was received without alteration of parts, or diminution ot its gravity. Now herein to deliver ſomewhat which in a middle way may be en- rertained;we firſt affirm & few I beleeve will deny it,that the ſubſtance of gold is indeed invincible by the powerfulleſt aRion of narurall heat, =d that not only alimenrally in a ſubſtantiall mutation, but alſo medi- camentally in any corporeall converſion, as is very evident, not only in the ſwallowing of golden bullers butin the lefler and foligte diviſions thereof, paſſing the ſtomack and guts evenas it doth the throat, that is without abatement of weight or confiſtence; fo that it entererh nor the veynes with thoſe eleQuaries, wherein it is mixed , but taketh leave of

the wiſhes of Midas. And little credit there is tobe given to the golden Hen, related by Wendlerus. And fo likewiſe inthe extinion of gold, we muſt not conceive it parteth with any of its ſalt or difſoluble principle thereby, as we may affirme of Iron , for the parts thereof are fixed beyond diviſion z nor will they ſeperate upon the ſtrongeſt teſt] of fire. And this we affirme of pure gold , for that which is currant and paſſeth in ſtampe amongſt us, by reaſon of its allay , which is a proportion of copper mixed therewith, it is aQually dequantitated by fire, and poſſibly by frequent extinRion,
Secondly, alchough the ſubſtance of gold be not ſenſibly immuted or its gravity at all decreaſed , yetthat from thence ſome vertue may proceed either in ſubſtantiall reception or infuſion, we cannot ſafely deny. For poſſible it is that bodyes may emit a vertue and operation ur pot abatement of weight, as is moſt evident in the Loadſtone, whoſe effluencies are both continuall and communicable without a minoration of gravity. And the likg,is obſervable in bodies electricall, whoſe emiſſions are leſſe ſubtile. So wilt a Diamond or Saphire emit an effluvium ſufficient to move the needle or a ſtraw without dimi- nution of weight. Nor will poliſhed amber although ir ſend forth a erofſe and corporall exhalement be found a long time defeRive upon the ex3eſt ſcales.
Thirdly, if amulets doe worke by Aporrhoias, or emanations from their bodies, upon thoſe parts whereuntothey —_— , and are not yet abſerved to abate their weight; if they produce viſible and re- all effeRs by imponderous and inviſible emiſſions , it may be unjuſt to deny all efficacie of gold in the non- omiſſion of weight,or deperdition | of any ponderous particles. |
Laſtly, ſince Stibium or glaſſe of Antimony , Gnce alſo its Regulus | will manifeſtly communicate unto water, or wine, a purging and vo- | mitory operation; and yet the body it ſelfe, though after iterated infu- | fions, cannot be found to abate cither vertue or weight; I dare not de- ny but gold may doe the like ; that is, impart ſome effluences unto the | infuſion which carry with them the ſubtiler nature, and ſeparable con- ditions of its body.
That therefore this mettall thus received,hath any undeniable effe@ | upon the body either from experience in others or my ſelfe , I cannot | ſatisfaRorily affirm. That poſſibly it may havel not wil at all deny. But | from power unto a, froma poſſible unto an aQualloperation, the in- ference is not-reaſonable. And therefore fince the point is dubious, and not yet authentically decided , it will be diſcretion not to _ on diſputable remedies; but rather in caſes of knowne danger, to have recourſe unto medicines of knowne and approved aRivity z for beſide the benefit accruing unto the ficke, hereby may be avoyded a grofſc and frequent error, commonly committed in the uſe of ——_ re-

medies,conjoyntly with thoſe which are of approved vertue. Thatis, to impute the cure unto the conceited remedy, or place it on that whereon they place their opinion, whoſe operation h it be no- thing,or its concurrence not confiderable,yet doth it obtaine the name of the whole cure, and carryeth often the honour of the capitall ener- gie, which had no finger init, | 4. That a pot full of aſhes, will ſtill containe as much water as it would without them , although by Ariſtotle in his problems taken for granted , and ſo received by moſt , is ſurely very falſe, and not effe- Rible upon the ſtricteſt experiment I could ever make. For wkenthe ayery interſticies are filled , and as much of the ſalt of the aſbes as the watcr will imbibe is diſſolved, there remaines a grofile and terreous portion at the bottome which will poſlefſe a fpace by it ſelfe , accor- ing wheretothere will remaine a quantity of water not receiveable, ſo will it come to paſle ina pot of ſalt, although decrepitated; and ſo alſo in a pot of ſnow. For ſo much it will wantin reception, as its ſo- lution up, according unto the bulke whereof, there will remaine a portion of water not to be admitted. So a glaſle ſtuffed with peeces of ſpunge, will want abour a fixt part of what it would receive without
it, Soſuger will not diflolve beyond the capacity ofthe water, nor a |
mettall in Aqua-fortis bee corroded beyond its reception. And ſo a
pint of ſalt of cartar expoſed unto a moiſt aire untill it difſolve , will make far more liquor, oras ſome tearm it oyle, then the former mea- ſure will contain.
Nor is it only the excluſion of ayre by watcr, or repletion of cavi- ties poſſeſſed thereby which cauſeth a pot of aſhes to admit ſo great a quantity of water, but alſo the ſolution of the ſalt of the aſhes into the | body of the diffolvent ; ſo a ye of aſhes will receive ſomewhat more | of hot water then of cold , for as much as the warme water imbibeth more of the ſalt, and a veflell of aſhes more then one of pinduſt or fi- lings of Iron,and a glafle full of water, will yet drinke in a proportion of {alt or ſuger without overflowing,
5. Of white powder and ſuch asis diſcharged without report,there is no {mall noiſe in the world : but how far agreeable unto truth , few I perceive are able to determine. Herein therefore to ſatisfie the doubts of ſome,and amuſe the credulity of others, We firſt declareythat gun- powder conſiſteth of three ingredients, that is, Salt-peter, Smal- coale, and Brimſtone. Salt-peter , although it be alſo narwrall and found in ſeverall | n_ et is that of commonule an artificiall ſalt,drawa from the infuſion of he earth, as that of Stals. Stables, Dovchouſes, Ceclless, and other covercd places, where the raine canneither difſolve, nor the ſunne approachto reſolve it. Brimſtone is a Minerall body of fat and iflamable parts, and this is uſed crude, and calledſulphur vive, and is | ot a {adder colour, or after depuration, ſuch as we have in magdcleans |

or rolls,of a lighter ycllow : Smal-coale is commonly known unto all, | and for this uſe is made of Sallow, Willow, Alder,Haſell,and the like, which three proportionably mixed,tempered, and formed into granu-
lary bodies, doe make up that powder which is in uſe for gunnes. Now all theſe although they bear a ſhare in the diſcharge , yet have they diſtin& intentions, and different offices in the compoſition : from brimſtone proceedeth the continued and durable firing,for Small coal | and peter together will onely ſpit , nor eaſily continue the ignition, From Small-coale enſueth the black colour and quicke accenfion, for neither brimſtone nor peter , although in powder , will take fire like Small-coale, nor will they cafily kindle upon the ſparks of a flint, as neither will Camphire a body very inflamable, but ſmall-coal is cqui-| volent to tinder,and ſerveth to light the ſulphur : from 'ſalr-peter pro- ceedeth the force and the report, for ſulphur and ſmall- coale mixed will not take fire with noiſe, or exilition, and powder which is made of impure, and greahie peter, hath buta weake emiſſion, 2nd giveth a faint report,and therefore in the three ſorts of powder , the ſtrongeſt con- taineth moſt ſalt-peter , and the proportion thereof is at the leaſt ten | | parts of peter, unto one of coale and ſulphur.
— —__—
Bur the immediate cauſe of the reporr, is the veliement commotion of the ayre upon the ſudden and violent eruption of the powder, tor that being ſuddenly fired, and almoſt altogether, being thus ratified it requireth by many degrees a greater ſpace then before irs body oc- cupied; but finding reſiſtance, ir aRiuely forceth out his way , and by concuſſion of the aire,occafioneth the report. Now with what vigour and violence it forceth upon the aire, may eafily be conceived , it wee admit what Cardan affirmeth , that the powder fired doth occupie a hundred times a greater ſpace then its own bulke, or rather what Snel- lius more exaQtly accounteth;that it exceedeth its former ſpace no leſle | then 12000, and 500. times. And this is the reaſon not onely of this tonnitruous and fulmioating report of gunnes, but may reſolve the cauſe of thoſe terrible cracks, and affrighting noiſe of heaven; that is, the nitrous and ſulphureous exhalations , ſct on fire in the cloudes, whereupon requiring a larger place, they force out their way,not only with the breaking of the cloud, bur the laceration of the ayre abour ir. | When if the matter be ſpirituons, and the cloud compa, the noiſe is great and terrible : If che cloud be thinne,and the materials weake, the eruption is languide, and ending in corruſcations without any noylſe, although bur at the diſtance of two miles , which is eſtcemed the re- moteſt diſtance of clouds; and therefore ſuch lightnings doe ſeldome | any harme. And therefore alſo it is prodigious to have thunder ina cleare skye,as is obſervably recorded in ſome Hiſtories.
Now therefore, he that would deſtroy the report of Powder, muſt worke upon the peter, he that would exchange the colour, muſt thinke how

how to alter the {mall coale. For the one, that is, to make white pow- der, it is ſurely many wayes feaſible: The beſt I know is by the pow der of rotten willowes , ſpunck, or touchwood prepared, might per- haps make it ruſſet : and ſome as Beringuccio in his Pyrotechoy afficm- eth, have promiſed to make it red. All which notwithſtanding doth little concerne the report : for that as wee have ſhewed on an other ingredient; and therefore alſo under the color of blacke ; chis rinciple is very variable, for if is made not onely by Willow, Aller, Hazell, &c. But ſome above all commend the coales of Fl:xe and Ruſhes, and ſome alſo contend the ſame may bee effected with Tinder.
As for the other, that is, to deſtroy the Report , it is reaſonably at- tempted but two wayes; that 1s, either by quite leaving ont. or elſe by filencing the Salt-peter. How to abate the vigonr thereot, or (ilence its hanlitaien.s way is promiſed by Porta, and that nor onely in ge- nerall termes by ſome fat bodies, but in particular by Borax and Buer mixed in a due proportion; which ſayeth he,will ſo goe off as ſcarce to be heard by che diſcharger; and indeed plentifully mixed , it will al- moſt take off the reporr,and
alſo the force of the charge. That it may be thus made without Salt-peter, I have met with but one example, that is, of Alphonſus Duke of Ferrara, who in the relation of Brafla- volus and Cardan invented ſuch a Powder,as would diſcharge a bullet without report.
That therefore white Powder there may be, there is therein no ab-
poſſibility. But this however, contrived either with or without Salt- ae will ſurely be of lictle force, and the effeRs thereof no way to
feared: For as it omits of report, ſo will it of effeuall excluſion, for ſceing as we have delivered the ſtrength and report, do neceſſarily depend upon the violent excluſion, where there is no report there will beno vice excluſion, and ſo the charge of no force which is exclu- ded. For thus much is reported of that famous powderof Alphonſus, which was not of force enough to kill a chicken , according to the de-

It is very true and not to bee denyed, there are wayes to diſcharge a bullet , not only with powder that makes no noiſe, but without any powder at all , as is done by water and windegunnes ; but theſe afford no fulminating report, and depend on ſingle principles,and even in or- dinary __ there are pretended other wayes, to alterthe noiſe and ſtrength of the diſcharge, and the beſt, if not onely way conſiſts in the quality of the Nitre : for as for other wayes which make cither addi- tions or alterations in the powder, or charge, I finde therein no cffeR,

Qiickfilyer, or unto every pound of peter , one ounce of Sal Armo- niac will much intend the force, and conſequently report , as Berin- | guccio hach delivered, I find no verity therein. That a piece of Opium will dead the force, and blow as ſome have promiſed , I finde herein no ſuch peculiarity, no more then in any gumme or viſcole bedy, and 25 much effcR there is to be found from Scammonie. That a bullet dipped in oyle by preventing the tranſpiration of ayre, will carry far- ther, and peirce deeper, as Portu affirmeth, my experience cannot with ſatis{aRion diſcerne. That Quickſilver is more diſtruRive then ſhot is ſurely not to be made outs for it will ſcarce make any penetration , and diſcharged from a Piſtoll , will hardly pierce thorow a parchment. Thar vineger , ſpirits of wine, or the diſtilled water of Orange pilles, wherewith the powder is tempored , are more effeRuall unto the re- port then common water, as ſome doe promiſe, I ſhall not affirme, but may aſſuredly be more conduceable unto the preſervation and durance of the powder, as Cataneo hath well obſerved. | But beſide the prevalent report from Salt-peter by ſome antipathic, | or incummiſcibility therewith upon the approach of fire. Sulphur may hold a greater uſe in the compoſition and further aQvitie in the exclu- fion then is by moſt conceived; for ſulphur vive makes better pow- der then common ſulphur, which nevertheleſſe.is of as quicke accenſi- on as the other, for Small- coale, Salt-peter and Camphire made into powder will bee of little force , wherein notwithſtanding there wants not the accending ingredient; for Camphirethough it Lame well, yet will not fluſh ſo lively, or defecate Salt- peter , if you injeR it thereon like ſulphur, as in the preparation of S/ prene{e, And laſtly, though many wayes may be found to light this powder , yet is there none I know to make a ſtrong and vigorous powder of Salt-peter , without the admixion of ſulphur. Arſenick red and yellow, that is, Orpement ' and Sandarach may perhaps doe ſomething, as being inflamable and | containing ſulphur in them, but containing alſo a ſal, and hydr mixtion, they will be of little effeR z and white or Criſtaline arſenick | of lefle, forthat being artficiall, and ſublimed with ſale , will not en- | dure flamation. , | Aad this antipathy or contention between faltpeter and ſulphur ; upon an aQtuall fire, and in their compleat 8& diſtin bodies, is alſo ma-  nifeſted in their preparations , and bodies which inviſibly containe ; them. Thus isthe preparation of Crocus Metallorum,the matter kind-  leth and fluſheth like Gunpowder , whercin notwithſtanding, there is | nothing but Antimony and Saltpeter , but this proceedeth from the | {ulphur of Antimony, not enduring the ſociety of ſaltpeter ; for after | three or foure accenſions, through a freſh addition of peter, the pow- | der will fluſhno more; for the ſulphur of the Amtimony is quite exha- | led.

This Gentle- | Copy. man, ſaith he, deſirous to finde the nature of Corall,and to be reſolved | | how it groweth at the bottome of the Sea, cauſed a man to goe downe 00 lefſe then a hundred fathom into the Sea, with expreſle to take no- tice whether it were hard or ſoft in the place where it groweth, who returning brought in cach hand a branch of Corall, affirming it was as | hard atthe botrome, as in the ayre where he delivered it. The ſame was alſo confirmed by a triallof his owne, handling ita fathome under water before it feltthe ayre. Boetius de Boore in his accurate TraRt De Gemmis, is of the ſame opinion, not aſcribing its concretion unto the ayre, but the coagulating ſpirits of ſalt, and lapidificall juyceof the ſea, which.entring the parts of that plant, overcomes its vegerability, and converts it into a lapideous ſubſtance, and this, ſaith he, doth happen whenthe plant is ready to decay ; for all Corall is not hard, and in many concreted plants ſome parts remaine unpetrified, that is, the quick and livelier parts remaine as wood, and were never yet conver- ted. Now that plants and ligneous bodies may indurate under 'water without approachment of ayre, we have experiment in Coralline,with many Coralloidall concretions , and that little ſtony plant which Mr. Johnſon nameth, Hippuris coralloides, and Geſner folis minſu 4re- noſis ; we have our ſelfe tound in freſh water, which is the leſſe concre- tive portion of that clement. We have alſo with us the viſible petri- fication of wood in many waters, whereof ſo much as is covered with water converteth into ſtone, as much as is aboye itand in the ayre re- taineth the forme of wood, and continueth as before.

The received diſtinRion and common notation by ſexes , hath alſo promoted the conceit, for true it is,that Herbaliſts from ancient times, have thus diſtinguiſhed them; naming that the maſle, whoſe leaves are lighter, and fruit and apples rounder,but this is properly no geherative diviſion, but rather ſome note of diſtinRion in colour , figure or ope- ration, For though Empedocles affirme, there is a mixt, and undivi- ded ſex in vegetables; and Scaliger upon Ariſtotle de plantis, doth fa-
vourably explain that opinion, yet will it not conſiſt with the common | and ordinary acception, nor yct with Ariſtotles definition : for if chat | be maſle which generates in another, that female which procreatesin | it ſelfe , if it be underſtood of ſexes conjoyned, all plants are female, and if of dif joyned, and congreſlive generation, there is no male or fe- male in them atall. | But the Aclas or waine axis, which ſupported this opinion , was daily experience, ard the viſible teſtimony of ſenſe z for many there are in ſeverall parts of Europe who carry about , and ſcil rootes unto ignorant people , which handſomely make out the ſhape of man or woman, but theſc are not productions of Nature, but contrivances of Art, as divers have noted, and Mathiolus plainly deteRted, who-learned this way of trumpery from a —— under his cure | for the Frenchdiſcaſez his words are theſe, and may determine the p_ Sedprofetis vanum & fabuloſum, &c.

All which like other impoſtures once diſcovered is cafily effeRed,and inthe root of white Bryony may be praQtiſed every ſprivg.
What is there fore delivered in favour hereof, by Authors ancient or moderne, muſt have its root in tradition, impoſture, or farre deri- ved fimilitude z ſo may we admit ofthe epithyte of Pythegoras who calls it 4+2+=%@2p9 25, and that of Columella , who tears it ſemsihowe, otherwiſe Albertus mwagaws is not to be received when he affirmerh that Mandrakes ſo repretent mankinde,that diſtinRion of ſex and other accidents are manifeſt therein. And under theſe tearms may thoſe Authors bee admitted , which for this opinion are introduced by Drufius , as David Camius, Moſes filius Namanis, and Abenezra Hiſpanus.
The ſecond affertion concerneth its produRion, "That it naturally groweth under gallowſes and places of execution, ariſing from fat or thy urine that drops from the body of the dead ; a ſtory ſomewhat agree- | able unto the fable of the Serpents teeth ſowed inthe earth by Cad- mus, or rather the birth of Orion from the urine of Jupiter, Mercurie, and Neptune : Now this opinion ſeems grounded onthe former, that is a conceived fimilitude it hath with man; and therefore ffom him in ſome way they would make out its prodaRtion. Which conceit is not only erroneous in the foundation, but injurious unto Philoſophy in the | ſuperſtruQRion , making putrifaRive generations , correſpondent unto ſeminall produQions, and conceiving in equivocall effeRs and univo- call conformity unto the efficient ; which is ſo far from being verified | of animalls intheir corruptive mutations into plants , that they main- | taine not this ſimilitude in their nearer tranſlation into animalls. So when the Oxe corrupteth into Bees, or the Horſes into hornets, they come not forth inthe image of their originalls. So the corrupt and ex+ crementous humors in man are animated into lyce;and we may obſetve that hogs, ſheep, goats, hawkes, hens, and divers other, have one pe- culiar and proper kind of vermine , not reſembling themſelves accor- ding to ſeminall conditions, it carrying a ſetled and confined habitude unto their corruptive originalls; and therefore come not forth in gene- rations erraticall , or different from each other , but ſeem ſpecifically and in regular ſhapes to attend the corruption of their bodycs , as dor more perfeR conceptions, the rule of ſeminall produRions.

The lat concerneth the danger enſuing , that there followes at ha- zard of life to them that pull it up , that {ome evill fate purſues them, and they live not very long after ; therefore the attempt hereof among the Ancients, was not in ordinary way, but as Pliny informeth, when they intended to take up the root of this plant , they tooke the wind thereof, and with a ſword deſcribing three circles about it they digged it up, leoking toward the Weſt,a conceit not only injurious unto truth, and confutable by dayly experience, but ſomewhat derogatory unto the providence of God, that is not only to impoſe ſo deſtruRtive a qua- lity en any plant, but conceive a vegetable whoſe partsare uſcfull unto| many, ſhould in the only taking up prove mortall unto any. Tothink | he ſuffereth the poyſon of Nubia to be gathered, Napcllus, Aconite and Thorato be eradicated, yet this not to he moved. That hee per- mitteth Arſenick and minerall poyſons to be forced from the bowells of thecarth, yet not this from che ſurface thereof. This were to intro- | duce a ſecond forbidden truir, and inhance the fiiſt malediQion ; ma- king it not only mortall for Adam to tafte the one, but capitall unto his | poſterity to eradicate or dig up the other.
Now what begot , at leaſt p:omoted ſo ſtrange coneeptions might be the magicall opinion hereot;this being conceived the plant ſo much! in uſe with Circe, and therefore named Circea, as Diolcorides and Theophraſtus have delivered 3 which being the eminent ſoceres of elder ſtory , and by the magicke of ſimples beleeved to have wrought many wonders, ſome men were apt to invent , others to beleeve any tradition or magicall promiſe thereof. ..
Analogus relations concerning other plants, and ſuch as are of neare affinity unto this, have made its currant ſmooth, and paſſe more caſily among us; for the ſame cffc is alſo delivered by Joſephus, concer- ning the root Baaras, by Alian of Cynoſpaſtus, and we 1cad in Homer the very ſame opinion concerning Moly.

2. That Cinamon, Ginger, Clove, Mace and Nutmeg,are but the ſcverall parts and fruits of the ſame tree,is the common belicfe of thoſe which daily uſe them;whereofto ſpeak diſtinaly,Ginger is the root of neither tree nor ſhrub. but of an herbaceous plant,reſembling the water flower De luce, as Garcias firſt deſcribed, or rather the common reed, ' as Lobelius fince affirmed, very common in many parts of India,grow- | ing either from root or ſeed , which in December and: January they take up, and gently dryed, role itup in carth, whereby occluding the pores, they conſerve the naturall humidity, and ſo prevent corwption.
Cinnamon is the inward barke of a Cinnamon tree, whereof the |
beſt is brought from Zeilan;this freed'from the ourward barke,and ex-  poled unto the Sun , contracts intothoſe folds wherein we commonly | receive it, If it have not a ſufficient inſolation it looketh pale , and at- | taines not its laudable colour, if it be ſunned too long it ſuffererh a tor- | refaion, and deſcendeth ſomewhat below ir.
Clove is the rudiment or beginning of a fruit growing upon the Clove tree, to be found but in few Countries. The moſt commend- able is that of Iſles of Moluccaz it is firſt white,afterward green, which beaten downe, and dryed in the Sun becommeth blacke, and in the | complexion we receive it. FL149 |
Nutmeg is the fruit of a tree differing from all theſe, and as Garcias | | deſcribeth it, ſomewhat like a Peach, growing in divers places , bur | fruQifying inthe Ifle of Banda. The fruit hereof, conſiſteth of foure parts; the firft or outward part is a thick and carnous covering like that | of a Walnut. Thefecond a dry and floſculous coat, commonly called | Mace. The third a harder tegument or thell, which lyecth under | the Mace. The fourth a kernell inchuded inthe ſhell , which is the | ſame we call Nutmeg ; all which both in their parts and order of dif- | poſure, arecafily diſcerned inthoſe fruits, which are brovght in pre- terves unto us. |

3. Thar Viſcus Arborcus or Miſleltoe is bred upon trees, from leeds which birds, eſpecially Thruſhes and Ringdoveslct fall thereon, was the creed of the Ancients,and is ſtill beleeved among us,is the account of its production, ſet downe by Pliny, delivered by Virgil, and ſub. ſctibed by many more. Iffo, ſome reaſon mult be aſſigned , why it | oroweth onely upon certaine trees, and not upon many whereontheſe | birds do light. For as Exotick obſervers deliver, it groweth upon Al- | mond trees, Cheſnut, Apples, Oakes, and Pine trees, as wee obſerve | in England, very commonly upon Apple, Holly, Bayes, Crabs , and | White thorne, ſometimes upon Sallow, Haſell, and Oake, never upon Bayes, Holly, Aſhes, Elmes, and many others. Why itgroweth not in all countries and places where theſe birds are found, for ſo Braflayolus 2fficmeth, it is notto-be found in the territorie of Ferrara, and was faineto ſupply himſelfe from other parts of Italy. Why if it ariſeth | from a ſeed, if fowne it will not grow againe, as Pliny affirmeth.and as by ſetting the berryes thereof, wee have in vaine —_ its produ- ion; why it it commeth from ſed that falleth upon the tree,it grow- cth often downewards and puts forth under the bough , where ſeed can neither fall, gor yet remaine. Hereof beſide ſome others,the Lord Verulam hath taken notice. And they ſurely ſpeake probably who make it an arboreous excreſcence, or rather ſuperplant , bred ofa viſ- cous and ſuperfluous ſappe the tree it ſelfe cannot aſſimilate , and therefore ſprouteth not forth in boughs and ſurcles of the ſame ſhape and fimilary untothe tree that beareth it , but in a different | forme, and ſecondary unto its ſpecificall intention, wherein once fay- | ling, another forme ſucceedeth, and inthe firſt placethat of Miſſcltoe, | in plants and trees diſpoſed to its prodution. And therefore alſo | where ever it groweth. it is of conſtant ſhape, and mainfaines a regular ; figure like other ſupercreſcenſes , and ſuch as living upon the ſtock of | | others, are termed Paraſiticall plants, as Polypody, Moſle, the {maller
| Capillaries, and many more.
Now what begot this conceit , might be the enlargement of that part of truth conteined in its ſtory. For certaine it is, that ſome birdes doe feed upon the berries of this vegetable , and we meet in Ariſtotle | with one kind of thruſh called #:c-6-, the miflell thruſh or feeder ; Upon miſleltoe. But that which hath moſt promoted it, is a received | proverb. Tsrdas ſibi malum cacat; Appliable unto ſuch men as are au- | | thors of their owne misfortune : For according unto ancient tradition | and Plinies relation, the bird not able to digeſt the fruit whereon ſhee feedeth, from her inconverted muting,ariſeth this plant, of the berries whereof birdlime is made, wherewith ſhe is after entangled. Now al- | though proverbs bee popular principles, yet is not all true that is pro- yerbiall,

[ verbiall; and in many thereof there being one thing delivered,and ano» | ther intended, though the verball expreſſion be falſe, the proverbe is | true enough inthe veritie of its intention. | | As for the Magicall vertues in this plant , and conceived efficacie | unto yeneficiall intentions, it ſeemeth unco me a Pagan relique derived | from the ancient Dcuides , the great admirers of the Oake, eſpecially | the Miſfeltoe that grew thereon; which according unto the particular of Plinie, they gathered with great ſolemnitie. For after ſacrifice the | prieſt in a white garment, aſcended the tree, cutdowne the Miſſeltoc | with a golden hooke,and received it in a white coat, the vertue wherc- | of wasto reſiſt all poyſons,and make fruitfull any that uſed it.

Countrey pradtiſe hath added anather , to pro- voke the atter-birth, and in that caſe the decoRion is given unto Cowes. That the berrics are poiſon as ſome conceive, we are {o far from averring, that we have fſatcly given them inwardly, and can con- |
firme the experiment of Braſlavolus , that they have ſome purgative | |
uality. , 4- The Roſe of Jerico,that flouriſhes every yeer juſt uponChriſtmas Eve is famous in Chriſtian reports , which notwithſtanding wee have ſome reaſon to doubt; and we are plainely informed by ius, it is but a Monaſticall impoſture, as hee hath delivered in his obſervations, concerning the plants in Jericho. That which promoted the conceit, or perhaps begot irs continuance , was a proprietie in this plane. For| chough it bee dry, yet will it upon imbibition of moiſture dilate its leaves, and explicate its flowers contraed, and ſeemingly dryed up. And this is to bee effeRed not onely inthe plant yer growing , but in ſome manner alſo inthat which is brought exuccous and dry unto us. Which quality being obſcrved,the ſubtilty of contrivers did com- monly play this ſhew upon the Eve of our Saviours Nativitie, and by drying the plant againe , it cloſed the next day, and ſo pretended a double myſtery. That is the opening and clofing of the wombe of Marty.

It hath much deceived the hopes of good fellowes,what is com- monly expeRed of bitter Almonds,and though in Plutarch confirmed from the praQtiſe of Claudius his Phyfitian, that Antidote againſt ebriety hath commonly failed. Surely men much verſt inthe praQiice doe erre inthe theory of inebriation, conceaving inthat diſturbance the braine doth onely ſuffer from exhalations and yaporous aſcemions from the ſtomack , which far and oylie ſubſtances may ſuppreſle, whereas the prevalent intoxication is from the ſpirits of drink diſperſed intothe yeynes and arteries , from whence by common conveyances they creep into the braine, infinuate into irs ventricles, and thole vertigoes, accompanying that perverſion. And therefore the ſame ct- fe& may be produced by a Gliſter, the head may be intoxicated by a medicine at the heele. And ſo the poyſonous bytes of Serpents, al- chough on parrs at diſtance from the head , yet having cntered the veynes, diſturbe the animall facultics,and produce the of drink, or poyſon ſwallowed. And ſo as the head may bee diſturbed bythe skin, it may the ſame way be relieved, as is obſervable in balneations, waſhings, and fomentations, either of the whole body, orof that par: | alone.
$, That every plant might receive a name according unto the diſ- caſe it cureth, was the wiſh of Paracelſus ; a way more likely to mul- tiply Empericks then Herbaliſts, yer what is praRiſed by many is ad- v unto neither ; that is, relinquiſhing cheir proper appellati- ons, to re-baptiſe them by the name of Saints, Apoſtles, Patriarcks and Martyres, to call this the herbe of John, that of Perer, this of Jarties or Joſeph, that of Mary or Barbara, for hereby apprehenfions are made additionall unto their proper natures; whercon ſuperſtitious praQiſes enſue, and ſtories are framed accordingly ro make good their foun- dations.
9. We cannot omit to declare the groſle miſtake of many inthe no- minall apprehenfion of plants ; to inſtance but in few. Anherbe there is commonly called Betonica Pauli, or Pauls Betony, hereof the peo- ple bave ſome conceit in reference to S.Paul , whereas indeed that name is derived from Paulus Bgineta, an ancient Phyfician of Zgina, and is no more then ſpeed well, or Fluellen. Thelike expeRations are raiſed from Herbs Trin#ats, which notwithſtanding obtaineth that ame onely from the figure of its leaves, and is one kinde of liverworte \ or Hepatica.

That there is a property in Bafil to propagate Scorpions, and that by the ſmell thercot they are bred in the braines of men, is much advanced by Hollerius , who found this inſein the braines of a man that delighted much in this ſmel. Where- in befide that wee finde no way to conjoyne the effec unto the cauſe aligned; herein the Modernes ſpeake but timerouſly , and ſame of the Ancients quite contrarily, For, according unto Oribafius, Phyficion un'o Julian, The Aﬀeicans, men beſt experienced in poyſons, affirme whoſoever hath eaten Bafil , although hee be ſtung with a Scorpion, ſhall feele no paine thereby : which 1s a very different efteR, and rather 2ntidotally deſtroying then ſeminally promoting its production. |
That the leaves of Cataputia or ſpurge being plucked upward or downeward reſpeQively performe their operations by purge or yomit, | 35 ſome have written, and old wives ſtill do preach,is a ſtrange conceit, and indeed ſomewhat magneticall, aſcribing unto plants poſitionall o- perations, and after the manner of the Loadſtone,uponthe pole where- | of if aknite be drawne from the handle unto the poynt, it will cake up | a neele, but if drawne apaine from the point tothe handle, it will at- | tract it no more. |

Laſtly , they forget or conſult not experience, whereof not many yeares paſt , we have had the advantage in England , by an Elephant ſhewne in many parts thereof not only inthe poſture of ſtanding, but kneeling and lying downe whereby alchough the opinionat preſent be reaſonable well ſuppreſſed , yet fromthe ſtrings of traduion and fruicfull recurrence of error, it is not improbable, it may revive inthe next generation againe ; forthis was notthe firſt chat hath been ſeen in England, for (befides ſome ochers ſince ) as Polydore Virgil relateth, Lewis the French King ſent one to Henry the third 5 and Emanuel of Portugall another unto Leo the tenth into Iraly, where notwithſtand- ing the crrour is ſtill alive and epidemicall, as with us.
The hint and ground of this opinion might be the groſle and ſome- what Cylindricall compoſure of the legs, the cquality and leſſe per- ceptible diſpoſure of the joynts, eſpecially in the tore legs of this Ani- mall, they appearing when he ſtandeth like pillars of fleſh, without a- ny evidence of articulation: the different flexure and order of the joynts might alſo countenance the ſame, being not diſpoſed io the Elephant, as they arc inother quadrupedes , bur carry a nearer conformity into thoſe of man,that is the bought of the fore legs not direRly backward, but laterally and ſomewhat inward , but the hough or ſuffraginous flexure behinde rather outward , contrary unto many other Q112dru- pedes, and ſuch as can ſcratch the care with the hinder foot, as Horſes, Camells, Deere, Sheep and Dogs, for their fore legs bend like our legs, and their hinder legs like our armes, when we move them co our ſhoulders; but quadrupedes oviparous, as Frogs, Lizards, Crocodiles, have their joynts and motive flexures more analogouſly framed unto ours; and ſomeamong viviparous,that is ſuch thereof as can bring their forefcet and meat therein into their mouths, as moſt can doe that have the clanicles or coller. bones, whereby their breaſts are broader, and their ſhoulders more aſunder, as the Ape, the Monkey, the Squirrel, and ſome others : If therefore any ſhall afhirme the joynts of Elephants are differently framed from moſt of other Quadrupedes, and more ob- ſcurely and grofſely almoſt then any , he doth hercin no injury unto truth ; but if 4 <1 ſecundum quid ad diGum ſimpliciter , he affumeth alſo they have no articulations at all , he incurs the controlment of rea- ſon, and cannot ayoid the contradiQion of lene,

rience, we ſhall find it to be otherwiſe thenas is commonly preſumed, by ſawing away of trees; the accounts whereof are to be ſeen at
in 1ohannes Huge, Edwardus Lopes, Garclas ab Horto, Cademuſtme, and many more : other concernments there are of the Elephant , which might admit of diſcourſe , and if we ſhould queſtion the teeth of Ele- phants , that is whether they be properly ſo termed , or might not ra ther be called hornes, it were no new enquiry of mine, but a paradox as old as Oppianus: whether as Pliny and divers ſince affirme,that Ele- phants are terrified, and make away upon the grunting of Swine, Gar- cles ab Horto may decide , who affirmeth upon experience they enter their ftalles , and live promiſcuouſly inthe woods of Malayar 3 That the ſituation of the genitalls is averſe, and their copulation like that of Camells, as Pliny hath alſodelivered, is neither to be received, for we have beheld that part in a different poſition, and their coition is made by ſuperſaliency like that of horſes , as we are informed by ſome who have beheld them in that aR. That ſome Elephants have not only writ- ten whoſe ſentences, as Alian ocularly teſtifieth, but have alſo ſpoken, as Oppianus delivereth , and Chriftophorns a Coſta particularly rela- teth, although it ſound like that of Achilles horſe in Homer , wee doe not conceive impoſhble s nor beſide the affinity of reaſon in this Ani- mall any ſuch intolerable incapacity in the organs of divers other Qua- drupedes, whereby they might not be taught to ſpeake , or become imitators of ſpeech like birds, and indeed ſtrange it is how the curiofi-
ty of men that have been aRive in the inſtruRionof beaſts, have never fallen uponthis artifice , and among thoſe many paradoxicall and un-
that ſpake unto Eve,the Dogs &Cats,that uſually ſpeak unto W

I: is againe controulable by experience z for we have made fome | ſcarch and enquiry herein, encouraged by Abſyrtus a Greek Author, | in the cime of Conſtantine, whoin his Hippiaticks,obſcurely aſfigneth the gall a place in the liver; but more eſpecially by Ruino the Bononi- an, whoin his 42101 del Cowalle , hath more plainly deſcribed it, and in a manner as I found it; tor inthe difſeRions of Horſes, and par- ricular enquiry into that part, in the concave or ſimous part of the liver, | whereabout the gall is uſually feated in quadrupeds, I diſcover an hol- low, long and membranous ſubſtance of a yellow colour without, and | lined with choler and gall within 5 which part is by branches diffuſed into the lobes and ſeverall parcells of the liver, from whence receiving | the firic ſuperfluity , or cholericke remainder , upon the ſecond con- | coRion by a manifeſt and open paſſage, ic conveyeth it into the duode- | num or upper gut, thence into the lower bowells, which is the manner of its derivation in man and other animalls, and therefore although chere be no eminent and circular follicle, no ronnd e or veſicle which long containeth this humor , yet is therea manifeſt receptacle and paſſage of choler, from the liver into the guts; which being not ſo ſhut up, or at leaſt not ſo long detained, as ic is in other animalls, pro- cures that frequent excretion , and occaſions the horſe todupg more | often then many other ; for choler is the naturall gliſter, or one excre- tion whereby nature excludeth another , which deſcending daily into the bowells, extimulates thoſe parts, and excites them unto expulſion; and ſo when this humor aboundeth or corrupteth , there ſucceeds ott-' times a cholerica paſſio, that is a ſudden and vehement purgation up- ward and downward ; and ſo when the paſſage of gall becomes ob- ſtruſted , the body grows coſtive , and the excrements of the belly white, as it happeneth ofc-cimes inthe Jaundice.
If any therefore affirme an horſe hath no gall, that is, no receptacle, or part ordained for the ſeparation of choller,or not that humour at all, he hath both ſence and reaſon to oppoſe him ; but if ke ſaith it hath no bladder of gall, and ſuch azis obſerved in many other animals, we ſhall oppole our ſenſe if we gaineſay him; and thus muſt Ariſtotle be made out when he h this part, and by this diſtinRion wee may relieve Pliny ofa contradiion ; who in one place affirming an horſe hath no gall, delivereth yet in agother, that the gall of an horſe was accounted poylon, and therefore ar the ſacrifices of horſes in Rome , ir was un- lawfull forthe Flamen but to touch it , but with more difficulty, or hardly at all is that reconcilable which is delivered by our Countrey-

Cray, III. Of the Dove,
| Ti third Aﬀertion is ſomewhat like the ſecond , That a Dove or
Pigeon hath no gall, which is affirmed from very great Antiquity, for as Pierius obſcrveth, from this conſideration the Agyptians did make it the Hieroglyphick of meekenefle; it 'hath beene averred by many holy Writers, commonly delivered by Poſtillers and Commen- eators, who from the frequent mention of the Dove in the Canticles, the precept of our Saviour to bee wiſeas Serpents, and innocent as Doves, and eſpecially the appearance of the holy Ghoſt in the ſimi- lirude of this animall, have taken occaſion to ſet downe many affeRi- ons of the Dove , and what doth moſt commend it , is that it hath no Gall; and hereof have made uſe not onely inferivur and minor Di- vines, but Cyprian, Auſtin, Iſidore, Beda, Rupertus, Janſenius, and | many more. : Whereto notwithſtanding we know not how to aſſent, it being re- |pugnant unto the Authority and poſitive determination of ancient Phi- lolophy ; the affirmative of Ariſtotle in his biſtory of Animals is | plaine, Fel ali wentri, «lic inteftins ſjungitur ; Some have the Gall ad- joyned tothe guts,as the Crow, the Swallow, Sparrow,and the Dove, the ſame is alſo atteſted by Pliny , and not without ſome paſſion by Galen, who in his booke de C47r« bile, accounts him ridiculous that | denyes it.
It is not agreeableto the conſtitution of this Animall, nor can we ſo ' reaſonably conceive there wants a gall z that is, the hot and fiery hu- | mour in a body ſo hot of temper; which phlegme or meladcholy could | not effeR : Now of what complexion it is, Julius Alexmdrinus decla- reth, when he affirmeth , that ſome upon the uſe thereof, have fallen into Feavers and Quinſies ; the temper alſo of their dung and inteſtinall excretions do alſo confirme the ſame ; which Topically applyed be- come a Phznigmus or Rubifying medicine,and are of ſuch fiery parts, | that as we reade in Galen, they have of themſelves conceived fire,and burnt a houſe about them; and therefore when inthe famine of Sama- ria, (wherciothe fourth part of a cab of Pigeans dung was fold for five |

pieces of (ilyer) it is delivered by Joſephus , that men made uſe here- of inſtead of common ſalt, although the expoſicion ſeeme ſrange, it is more probable then many other; for that ir containeth very much ſalt ; beſide the effeRs before expreſled , it is diſcernable by taſte, and the earth of Columbarics or Dovchoules , ſo much defired in the attifice of Salt-peter; and to ſpeake generally , the excrements of birds which want both bladder and kidneys, hath more of ſalt and acrimony, then that of other animals, who beſide the guts have alſo thoſe conveyan- ces ; for whereas in theſe,the ſalt and lixiviated ſerofity with ſome por- tion of choler, is divided betweene the guts and bladder, it remaines | undevided in birds, and hath but a ſingle deſcent, by the guts, with the excluſions of the belly. Now if becauſe the Dove is of a milde and oentle nature, wee cannot conceive it ſhould be of an hottemper, our apprehenſions are not diſtin in the meaſure of conſtitutions , and the ſeveral parts which evidence ſuch conditions:for the Iraſcible paſſions doe follow the temper of the heart, but the concupiſcible diftraRtions the crzſis of the liver,now many have hot livers,which have but coole and temperate hearts, and this was probably the temper of Paris, a contrary conſticution to that of Aiax,and in both but ſhort of Medea, who ſcemed to exceed in cither.
Laſtly. it is repugnant to experience, for Anatomicall enquirie dif- covercth in them a gall , and that according to the determination of Ariſtotle, not annexed unto the Liver, but adhering unto the guts; nor is the humour contained in ſinaller veines, or obſcure capillations , but in a veſicle or little bladder , though ſome affirme it hath no cyſtis or | | bag atall, and therefore the Hieroglyphick of the Agyptians, though
allowable inthe ſence, is weake inthe foundation , who expreſſing | meekneſle and lenity by the portraR of a Dove with the taile ereRed, | afficmed it had no gall in the inward parts, but onely inthe-rumpe, and | as it were out of the body , and therefore if they conceived their gods | were pleaſed with the ſacrifice of this Animall, as being without gall, | the ancient Heathen were ſurcly miſtaken inthe reaſon, and in the very
oblation, whereas in the holocauſt or burnt offerings of Moſes the gall
was caſt away ; for as Ben Maimon inſtrugeth , the inwards whereto | the gall adhercth were taken out with the crop, according unto the | Law, Levit.z. which the Prieſt did oot burne, but caſt unto the Eaſt | that is, behinde his back , and readieſt place to be carricd out of the | SanQuary. And if they allo conceived that for this reaſon, they were the birds of Venus, and wanting the furious and diſcording part, were more acceptable unto the Deity of Love z they ſurely added unto the conceit, which was at firſt venereal], and in this animall may be ſufh- ciently made out from that conception. |
The ground of this conceit is partly like the former, that is, the ob- | {cure ſituationof the gall, and out of the Liver, whetcin it is common-

ly enquired, but this is a very injuſt 1llation, not well conſidering with what variety this part is ſeated ip birds ; in ſome both at the ſtomick and the liver,as in the Capriceps,in ſome at the liver only,as in Cocks, Turkeys, and Phaſiants, in others at the guts and Liver, as in Hawkes and Kites ; in ſome at theguts alone, as Crowes, Doves, and many more; and theſe perhaps may take up all the wayes of fituation , nor: onely in birds, bur alfo other animals, for what is ſaid of the Ancho-.| ny or i225in2\®r, that anſwerable unto its name, it carrieth the gall | inthe head, is further to be enquired; and though the diſcoloured par- | ticles in the skin of an Heron, be commonly termed Galls, yet is not this animall deficient in that part z and thus when it is conceived that the eyes of Tobias were cured by the gall of the fiſh Callyonimus or Scorpizs marinus, commended to that effeR by Dioſcorides, although chat part were not in the liver, were there reaſon to doubt that prob+- bility;avd whatſoever animall jt was, it may be received without cx- ception when tis delivered, the married couple as a teſtimony of tuture concord, did caſt the gall of the ſacrifice behinde the Altar? |
A tri and literall acception of a looſe and tropicall expreffion was a ſecond ground hereof z for while ſome affirmed it had nogall, intending onely thereby no evidence of anger or fury , otkers have conſtrued it anatomically, and denicd that part at all ; by which iltati- on we may inferre, and that from ſacred Text, a Pigeon hath no heart, according to that expreſſion, Hoſea 7.

Of the Bever,
Hata Beyer to eſcape the Hunter, bites off his teſticles or ſtones, is | a tenent very ancient, and hath had thereby advantage of propa- | gation; for the ſame we finde in the Hieroglyphicks of the A&gyprians, 'nthe Apologue of Aſope, an Author of great antiquity,who lived in che beginning of the Perſian Monarchy, and inthe time of Cyrus, the ſame is couched by Ariſtotle in his Echicks, but ſeriouſly delivered by | AZ&lian, Plinie and Solinus,with the ſame we meet with in Juvenal,who | by an handſome and metricall expreſſion more welcomely engrafts it | in our junior memories imnatus Caftora,qui ſe Eunuchum ipſe facit cupiens evadere damno Teſliculor um, adeo medicatum intelligit inguen, it | hath been propagated by Emblems , and ſome have been to bad Gra. | marians,as to be deceived by the name, deriving Caſtor 4 caſtrands, whereas, the proper Ltine word is Fiber, and Caſtor, but borrowed from the Greeke {ſo called quaſi 25, that is, Animal wvemricoſum, trom his {waggy and prominent belly,
Herein therefore ro ſpeake compendiouſly , wee firſt preſume to afficme, that from a ſtri enquiry,we cannot maintaine the evulſion or biting of any parts; and this is declareable from the beſt and moſt pro- teſſed Writers, for though ſome have made uſe hereof in a Morall or Tropicall way, yet have the profeſſed diſcourſers by filence deſerted, or by experience rcjeRed this aſſertion. Thus was it in ancient times diſcovered, and experimentally refuted by one Seſtius a Phyfician , as it ſtands related by Plinie, by Dioſcorides, who plainely afficmes that this tradition is falſe, by the diſcoveries of moderne Authors,who have expreſly diſcourſcd hereon,as Aldrovandus, Mathiolus, Geſnetus, Bel- lonius ; by Olaus Magnw, Peter Martyr and divers others, who have deſcribed the manner of their venations in America, they gene- rally omitting this way of their eſcape, and have delivered ſeverall other, by which they are daily caken.
The originall of the conceit was probably Hieroglyphicall , which after became Mythologicall unto the Grecks,& loſer down by &ſop, and by proceſle of tradition, ſtole into a totall yerity , which was but partially true,that is in i'ts covert ſenſe and morallity. Now why they placed this invenion upon the Bever , ( beſide the Medicall and Mer- chantable commodity of cefforeuw or parts conceived to be bitten away) might be the ſagacitic and wiſcdome of that animall, which in- deed from the workes it performes, and eſpecially i'rs artifice in build- ing is very ſtrange, and ſurcly not to be matched by any other, _

If therefore any affirme a wiſe man ſhould demeane himſelfe like the B:ver, who tocſcape with his life , contemneth the lofſe of his ge nirallsz that is, in caſe of extremity , not ſtriAly to endeavour the preſervation of all , butto fir downe in the why ern the greater good, though with the detriment and hazzard of the leſſer z wee may hereby apprehend a reall and uſefull cruth, and in this latirude of be- liefe , wee are content to receive the fable of Hippomanes whore deemed his life, with the loſſe of a galden ball, and whether true or talle, we rejeR not the tragedy of Abſyrtus, and the diſperſion of his members by Medea to perplex the purſuit of her father: bur if he ſhall poſitively affirmethis aR, and cannot belceve the morall , unlefſe hee alſocredit the fable, hee is ſurely greedy of delufion , and will hardly woide deception in theories of this nature. The error therefore and Alogic inth's opinion, is worſe then in the aſt , that is not to receive figures for realities, but expeRa verity in Apologues, and belceve, as ſerious zffirmations, confeſſed and ſtudied fables. * -
Againe, if this were true, and that the Beverin chaſe make ſome di- vulſionof parts,as that which we call Cofforears; yet are not rheſe putts avelled to be termed Tefſticles or ſtones, for theſe cods or follicles are found in both ſexes, though ſomewhat more protuberant in the tnale, there is hereto no derivation of the ſeminall parts,nor any paſſage from hence, unto the veſlels of cjaculations , ſome perforations onely inthe part it ſelfe,through which the humor included doth exudate, as may be obſerved in ſuch asare freſh.and not much dryed with age;and laſt- | ly, the Teſticles properly ſo called,are of a leſſer magnirude and ſeated ! iawardly upon the loynes and therefore it were not only a truicleſſe attempt, but impoſſible aR, to eucuchate or caſtrate themſelves, and might bee an hazardous practiſe of Arte, if at all attempted by 0- thers.,
Now all chis is confirmed from the experimentall teſtimony of five very memorable Authors; Bellogius, Gefnerus, Amatus, Rondelerius, and Mthiolus, who receivng che hint hereof from Rondeletius in the An.tomie of two Bevers, did finde all true that had been delivered by h'm, whoſe words are theſe in his learned book de Piſcibus > Fibri in 11:98 nibus gemines twmores habext utrinqueunicum, ovi Anſerini magni- tude, inter hos eff mentuls in maribus, in {a minis pudendum hitumeres reftes non ſunt. ſed follicul: membr 'ni cometh tm quorii medio finguli ſunt meas e qu'bus exudat liquor pinguss r ceveſus. quem ipſe Caſtor [eve id- wroto ore lambit &f exugn, poſtea veiut: oles.corperu partes oblinit, Hog tu- mores tefles non tte hinc maxime colligitur. quod ab illis nulla eft ad men- | tul-m 114 neque dutt us quo humor in mentule me tum derivetur & fo 48 emit .tur; preterea quod teftes intus reperiuntur, eoſdem tumores Moſcho |

Againe, it ſeems no cafie affront unto reaſon , and generally repug- nant unto the courſe of nature; for if we ſurvey the torall {et of animals, we may in their legs, or organs of progreſſion, obſerve an equality of length, and parity of numeration; that is, not any to have an odde leg, or the ſupporters and movers of one ſide not exaRly anſwered by the other; although the hinder may be unequall unto the fore and middle legs, as in Frogs, Locuſts and Graſhoppers , or both unto the middle, .| 25 in ſome bectles, and ſpiders, as is determined by Ariſtotle de inceſſ# animalium; perteR and viviparous quadrupeds, fo ſtanding in their po- | ſition of proneneſle, that the oppoſice joynrs of neighbour legs conſiſt in the ſame plaine, and a line deſcending from their navellinterſeRs at rightanglesthe axis of the earth : It happeneth often I confefſe that a Lobſter hath the chely or great claw of one fide longer then the other, burthis is not properly their leg, but a part of apprehenſion,and where- by they hold or ({cize upontheir prey z tor inthetn the legs and proper parts of progreſſion are inverted backward, and ſtand in a poſition op- poſice unto theſe. |

EC ao Ti Of the Beare,
J ix a Bear brings forth her young informous and unſhapen,which ſhe faſhionethafter by licking them over, is an opinion not only vulgar, and common with us at preſent, but hath been of old delivered by ancient Writers upon this foundation , it was a Hicroglyphicke a- mon the Agyptians; Ariſtotle ſeems to countenance it, Solinus, Plinic and Zlian directly aftirme it, and Ovid ſmoothly delivercth ir _ Nec catulus partu quem reddidit urſa recent! ” Sed male ia caro eft, lambends mater in arts Dacit & in formam qualem cupit ipſaredgcit.
Which opinion notwithſtanding is not only repugnant unto the ſcoſe of every one that ſhall with diligence enquire intoir, bur the exaR and deliberate experiment of three authenticke Philoſophers z the firſt of Mathiolus in his Comment on Dioſcorides , whoſe words are to this effeR. In the valley of Anagia about Trent,in a Beare which the Hun- ters eventcrated , I beheld the young ones with all their parts diſtinR, and not without ſhape, as many conceive, giving more credit unto Ariſtotle and Plinie, then experience and their proper ſenſes. Ot the ſame aſſurance was Julius Scaliger in his Exercitations , Y»ſamfatw informes potins ejicere, quem parere, ſi vera dicunt, quos poſtea linttw ef- fingat , Quid hujuſce fabule authoribus fidei habendum ex hac hiſtoria cogneſces, 1n noftris Alpibus venatores fatam urſam cepere, diſſetta ea fe. tus plane formats inte invents eſt : and laſtly , Aldrovandus who from the teſtimony of his owne eyes affirmeth , that in the cabinet of the Senate of Bononia, there was preſerved in aglaſſe a Cub difſeRed out of a Beare perfeRly tormed, and compleat in every part.
It is moreover injurious unto reaſon,and much impugneth the courſe and providence of nature, to conceive a birth ſhould be ordained be- fore there is a formation, forthe conformation of parts is neceſſarily required not only unto the prerequiſites and previous conditions of birth , as motion and animation , but allo unto the parturition or very birth it ſelfe; wherein not only the Dam, but the youngliogs play their parts, and the cauſe and aR ef excluſion proceedeth from them both : tor the excluſion of animals is not meerly paſſive like that of cgges,nor the totall aRion of delivery to be imputed unto the mother z but the firſt attempt beginneth from the Infant, which at the accompliſhed pe- riod attempteth'to change his manſion,and ſtrugling to come forth,di- lacerates and breaks thoſe parts which reſtrained him before.

Cunaye, VII. Of the Baſultsk,
M2 opinions are paſſant concerning the Bafiliske or little king | of Serpents, commonly called the Cockatrice, ſome affirming, | others denying, moſt doubting the relations made hereof; what there- | fore in theſe incertainties we may more ſurely determine, that ſuch an | animall there is , if we evadenotthe teſtimony of Scripture , and hu- mane Writers,we cannot ſafcly deny : So is it ſaid Pſal. 91. Super «ſþi- | dem & Baſiliſcum ambulabs, wherein the vulgar Tranſlation retaineth | che word of the Septuagint, uſing in other places the Latine expreſſion : Reewlws, as Proverb.23. Mordebit ut coluber , & ficut Regulus venus d4:ffundet , and Jeremy $8. Ecce ego mittam wobk ſerpentes Regwlos, &c. | T hat is, as ours tranſlate ir, Behold I will ſend Serpents, Cockatrices a- | mong you which will not be charmed, and they ſhall bite you; and as for humane Authors, or ſuch as have difcourſed of animals, or poy- | ſons, it is tobe found almoſt in all, as Dioſcorides, Galen, Pliny, Soli- aus, Ajay, Atius, Avicen, Ardoynus, Crevinus, and many more In Ariſtotle I confefſe we finde no mention, but Scaliger in his Comment and enumeration of Serpents, hath made ſupply , and in his Exercita- tions delivercth that a Bafilisk was found in Rome, in the dayes of Leo the fourth; and the like is reported by _ and ſome are fo farre from denying one, thatthey have made ſeverall kinds thereof, for ſuch is the Catoblepas of Pliny,” conecived by ſome, and the Dryinus of Arius by others. |
Bur although we deny not the exiſtence of the Baſilisk, yet whether we do not commonly miſtake in the conception hereof, and call that a
Baſilisk which is none at all, is ſurely to be queſtioned ; for certainely that which from the conceit of its generation we vulgarly call a Cock- | attice, and wherein (but under a different name ) we intend a formall Identity and adequate conception with the Baſilisk, is not the Baſilisk | ofthe Ancients, whereof ſuch wonders are delivered, For this of ours | is generally deſcribed with legs, wings,a ſerpentine and winding taile, and a criſt or combe ſomewhat like a Cock ; but the Baſilisk of elder times was a proper kinde of Serpent, not above three palmes long, as ſome account, and diffcrenced from other Serpents by advancing his head, and ſome white markes or coronary ſpots upon the crowne , as all authentick Writers have delivered. { Nor is this Cockatrice onely unlike the Baſiliske , but of no reall ſha in nature, and rather an Hicroglyphicall fancy, to expreſſe their different intentions, ſet forth in different faſhions; ſometimes with the head of a man, ſometimes with the head of an Hawke, as Pierius hath delivered , and as with addition of legs the Heralds and _ | ſtil

till deſcribe it ; nor was it onely of old a ſymbolicall and allowable invention, but is now become a manuall contrivance of Art , and arti- ficiall impoſture , whereof beſides others, Scaliger hath taken notice : Baflliſci formam mentisi ſunt vulge Gallinaces fimvilew, & pedibus biviy, neque enim abſiniles ſunt cateris ſerpemtibus, niſi macals quaſy in vertice candid, unde ili nomen Reginm, that is, men counterfeit the forme of a Baſilisk , with another like a Cock, and with two feet, whereas they differ not from other Serpents, but in a white ſpeck upon their crowne ; now akhough in ſome manner it might be counterferted in Indian Cocks, and flying Serpents , yet is t commonly contrived out of the skins of Thornebacks, Scaites or Maids, as Aldrovand hath [OSS PEO in his excellent booke of Fiſhes.
Nar is onely the exiſtency of this animall confiderable, but many things delivered thereof, particularly its poyſon, and its generation.

Bur laſtly, that this deſtruRtion ſhould be the effeR of the firſt be- holder, or depend upon priority of aſpection, is a point not eaſily to be ranted , and very hardly to be made out upon the principles of Ari. Parte, Alhazen, Vitcllo, and others ; who hold that fight is made by Reception, and not by Ex:ramifhon , by receiving the rayes of the ob- 4cR into the eye, and not by ſending any out , for hereby although he behold a man fiſt, the Bafilisk ſhould rather be deſtroyed , in regard | he firſt receiverh the rayes of his Antipathy and venemous emiſhons which obje&ively move his ſenſe; but how powerfull ſoever his owne poyſon be, it invadeth not the ſence of man, in regard he beholdeth h m not : and therefore this conceit was probably firſt begor by ſuch | as hc1d the contrary opinion of ſight by extramiſſion, as did Pyt ras, Plaro, Empedocles , Hipparchus, Galen , Macrobius , Pr | Simplic us, wich moſt of the Ancients, and is the poſtulate of Euclide in hs Opcicks : and of this opinion might they be, who fromthis An- ripathy of the Bafilisk and man,expreſled firſt the enmity of Chriſt and Sathan,and their mutuall deftruRion thereby ; when Satan being elder | then his humanity, beheld Chriſt firſt in the fleſh, and ſo he was de- ſt oyed by the Serpent, but E'der then Sathan in his Divinity , and ſo beholding him firſt he deſtroyed the old Baufilisk, and overcame the | «ffeRs of his poyſon, fin, death, and hell. | | As for the generation of the Baſilisk , that it proceedeth from a Cocks cgge hatched under a Toad or Serpent, it is a conceit as mon ſtrous as the brood it ſelfe : for if wee ſh uld grant that Cocks grow- ing 01d, and unable for emiſhon, amafſe within themſelves ſome ſemi-| rall matcer, which may after conglobate into the forme of an egge,yet , will this ſubſtance be unfruitfull, as wanting one principle of generati- on, and a commixcure of the ſced of both ſexes, which is required un- | top oduRtion, as may be obſcrved inthe egges of hens not trodden, and as we have madetriall in fome which are termed Cocks cgges, It is not indeed impoſſible that from the ſperme of a Cock, Hen,or other | | animall being once in putreſcence, either from incubation, or other- wiſc, ſome generation may enſue , net univocall and of the ſame ſpe- cies, bur ſome imperteR or monſtrous produRionz even as inthe body of man from putred humours, and peculiar wayes of corruption, there have ſucceeded ſtrange and unſeconded ſhapes of wormes, whereof we have beheld ſome our ſclves, and reade of others in medicall obſcrva- tions : and ſo may ſtrange and venemous Serpents be ſeverall waycs engendered ; but that this generation ſhould be regular, and alway produce a Bafilisk, is beyond our affi:mation,and we have good reaſon to doubt,
Againe, it is unreaſonable to aſcribe the equivocacy of this forme unto che hatching of a Toade, or imagine that diverſifics the produ- | Rion 3 for Incubation alters not the ſpecies, nor if wee obſerve it - muc

The occafion of this conceit might be an Agyptinn tradition con- cerning the bird Ibis, which after became transferred unto Cocks: for an old opinion it was of that Nation , that the Ibis feeding upon Ser- | Pets, that venemous food fo inquinated their ovall conceptions, or
ceges within their bodies, that they ſometimes came fouth in Serpen- | cine ſhapes, and therefore they alwayes brake their egges , nor would they endure the bird to fit upon them; bur how cauſeleſle their feare was herein, the daily Incubation of Ducks, Peahens, and many other | reſtifie, and the Stotke might have informed them , which bird they

Juch a Story as the Baſilisk is that of the Wolfe concerning priori- tic of viſion, that a man becomes hoarſe or dumb, if a Wolte have the advantage firſt to eye him, and this is in plaine language affirmed by Plinic : [» 1t4l14 4 creditwr, Luporam viſu eſt noxius, vocemque ho- mini, quem prizs contemplatur adimere ; {0 is it made out what is deli- vercd by Theocritus, and after him by Virgil———7Yox q#0q;Merim lam. fugit ipſa, Lups Marim videre prioves.

The ground or occaſional original hereof was probably the amaze- | ment and ſudden filence, the unexpeRed appearance of wolves do of- | ' ten put upon travellers; not by a ſuppoſed vapour, or venemous ema- nation, but a vehement fear which naturally produceth obmuteſcence, and ſometimes irrecoverable filence : thus birds are filent in pre- ſence of an hawk, and Plinie ſaith that dogs are mute in the ſhadow of | an Hy na; but thus could not the ſpirits of worthy Martyrs be filen- ced, who being expoſed not onely unto the eyes , but the mercileſle teeth of Wolves,gave lowd expreſſions of their faith, and their holy clamours were heard as high as heaven.
That which much promoted it beſide the common proverb, was an expreſſion in Theocritus, a very ancient Poet 5 g5iſtn auixor &s, Edeve 20n poteris vocem , Lycus efs tibr viſue 3 which Lycus was Rivall unto another, and ſuddenly appearing ſtopped the mouth of his Corriyall : now Lycus ſignifying alſo a Wolf, occafioned this apprehenfion; men taking that appellatively , which wasto be underſtood properly , and tranſlating the genuine acception; which is a fallacy of Aquivocation, and in ſome opinions begat the like conceit concerning Romulus and Remus,that they were foſtered by a Wolfe, the name of the nurſe be- ing Zeps, and founded the fable of Europa,and her carryage over Sca by a Bull, becauſe the Ship or Pilots name was Taurus ; and thus have ſome been ſtartled at the proverb Bos i» lings2,confuſedly apprehend- ing how a man ſhould be ſaid to haye an Oxe in his tongue, that would not ſpeake his minde; which was no more then that a piece of money had filenced him: for by the Oxe was onely implyed a piece of coine ſtamped with that figure , firſt currant with the Athenians , and afcer among the Romanes,

Gena" il Of Deere. |
He common opinion concerning the long life of Animals , is very | ancient,eſpecially of Crowes , Chaughes and Deerezin moderate |
accounts exceeding the age of man, in ſome the dayes of Neſtor, and | | in others ſurmounting the yeares of Artephius, or Methuſelah , from | whence Antiquity hath raiſed proverbiall expreſſions, and the real! |
conception of their duration, hath been the hyperbolicall expreſſion of | others. From all the reſt we ſhall ſingle out the Deere , upon concel- fion a long lived Animal, and in longzvity by many conceived to at- raine unto hundreds; wherein permitting every man his owne belicfe, weſhall our ſelves crave libertic to doubr,and our reaſons are theſe en- ſuing.
The firſt is that of Ariſtole,drawne from the increment and geſtati-
| on of this animal, thar is, it's ſudden arrivance unto growth and matu- ritie, and the ſmall time of it's remainder inthe wombe ; his words in | the tranſlation of Scaliger, are theſe ; Deejus vite /ongitudine fabulan- tur, neque enim 1ut geſtatio aut incrementum binnuloram ejuſmodi ſunt, ut praftent argumenturs longevi animals, that is, fables are raiſed con- |
| cerning the vivaſſity of Deere, for neither are their geſtation or incre- ment, ſuch as may afford an argument of long life; and theſe ſaith Sca- liger, are good mediums conjunRively taken, that is , not one without the other z For of animalls viviparous ſuch as live long, goe long with | | young, and atraine but ſlowly to their maturitie and ſtature; ſo the Horſe that liveth aboutthirty, arriveth unto his ſtature about fix years, and remaineth above nine moneths inthe wombe ; ſo the Camell that liveth unto fifry. goeth with young no leſle then ten moneths.and cea- ſeth not to grow before ſeaven;and ſo the Elephant that liveth an hun- dred, bearethi.'s young above a yeare , and arriveth unto perfeRion at twenty; on the contrary, the Sheep and Gon , which live but cight or ten ycares, goc but five moneths, and attaine to their perfeRion at two yeares, and the like is obſervable in Cats, Hires, and Conies; and fo the Deere that endureth the wombe but eight moneths, and is com- pleat at ſix yeares, from the courſe of nature, wee cannot expe to live an hundred , nor in any proportionall allowance much more then thir- ty,as having already paſſed ewo generall motions obſervable in all ani- mations, that is, it's beginning and encreaſe, and having but two more to runne thorow , that is, it's ſtate and declination, which are propor- nid ad-
EE
tionally ſet out by nature inevery kinde, and naturally proc mit of inference from each other.
The other ground that brings it's long life into ſuſpition, is theim- moderate ſalacity, and almoſt unparulleld exceſle of yenerie, which

every September may be obſerved in this Animall, and is ſuppoſed to fhorren the lives of Cockes, Partridges, and Sparrowes ; certainely a confeſſed and undeniable enemic unto longzuitic , and that not onely aS a ſigne in the complexionall defire, and impetuofitie, but alſo as a cauſe in the frequent aR,or iterated performance thereof; For though we conſent not with that Philoſopher, who thinks a ſpermaticall cmil- fion unto the waighe of one d is xquivalent unto the effuſion of ſixtie ounces of blood, yet c ing the reſolution and languor en. ſuing that aR in ſome, the extenuation and marcour in others , and the viſible acceleration it maketh of age in moſt, wee cannot but thinke it much abridgeth our dayes: although we alſo concede that this cxclu- ſion is _ that Romy it _ _ a way _ without ei- ther at or objeR z And although it be placed among the {1xe non na- eurals, that is, ſuch as neither naturally conſtitutive , nor meerly de- ſtruRive, doe preſerve or deſtroy according unto circumſtance , yet do we ſenſibly obſerve an impotencie or totall privation thereof, pro- longeth life , and they live longeſt inevery kinde that exercile it notat all, and this is true not onely in Eunuches by nature , but ſpadoes by Art ; For caſtrated animals in every ſpecicsare longer lived then they which retaine their virilities : For the genezation of bodies is not ct- ited 2s - 6s Conceive, ” x7ng that is, by lrcodioticn , or anſwera-
y unto the propagation of light, without us proper duninutiony but therein a tranſauſſon is made materially from ſome parts, and Ideally from every one, and the propagation of one , is in a ſtrict acception, ſome minoration of z and therefore alſo that axiome in Philo- ſophy, that the generation of one thing , is the corruption of another, although it be ſubſtantially true concerning the forme and matter , is alſo dilpofitively verified in the efficient or producer.
As for more ſenſible arguments,and ſuch as relate unto experiment, from theſe we have alſo reaſon to doubt its age , and preſumed vivaci- ty; for where long life is naturall, the markes of age are late, and when they appear, the journey unto death cannot be long. Now the age of a Dcere (as Ariſtotle long agoe obſerved) is beſt conjeRured , by the view or the hornes and from the hornes there is a particular and annuall account unto fix yeares, they ariſing firſt pJaine, and fo ſucceſ- fively branching , after which the judgement of their yeares by parti- cular markes becomes uncertainez but when they grow old,they grow lefle branched, and firſt doe loſe their «jwrr745, or #4, that is, their brow Antlers,or loweſt furcations next the head, which Ariſtotle ſaith the young ones uſe in fight, and the old as needles have them not at all, The ſame may be alſo colleRed from the lofle of their Teeth, whereof in old age they have few or none before in either jaw. Now theſc are infallible markes of age , and when they appeare , wee muſt confeſſe a declination , which notwithſtanding ( as men informe us in

)where obſervations may well be made,will happen between twenty and thirty : As for the bone or rather induration of the roots of the ancrial veyo,and great artery,which is thoughe to be found only in the heart of an old Deere, and therefore becomes more precious in irs rarity , it is often found in Deere , much under thirty , and wee have knowne ſome affirme they have found it in one of halfe that age, and therefore in that account of Plinie of -a Dcere with a collar about his necke, put op by Alexander the Great, and taken alive a hundred years after, with other relations of this nature we much ſuſpeR impoſture or miſtake z and if we grant their verity, they are but ſingle relations, and very rare contingencies in individualls, not affording a regular didu- ion upon the ſpecies : For though Ulyſſes his Dog lived unto twen- ty two, and the Achenian Mulc unto fourſcore , we doe not meaſure their dayes by thole yeares, or uſually ſay, they live thus long, nor can the three hundred years of John of times, or Neſtor , overthrow the aſſertion of Males , or afford a reaſonable cacouragement beyond his ſeptuagenary determination. | Theground and authority of this conceit was firſt Hieroglyphicall, the Egyptians expreſſing longzvitic by this animall , but upon what ugcertainties, and alſo convincible falfities they often ereRted ſuch emblems we have elſewhere delivered ; and if that were true which Ariſtotle delivers of his time, and Plinie was not afraidto take up long | aſter, the Agyptians could make but weake obſervations hercin z for
it be {3id that &ncas feaſted his followers with Veniſon , yer | Ariſtotle affirms that neither Dcer nor Boar were to be found in Afti- caz and how far they miſcounted the lives and duration of Animals, is evident from their conceit of the Crow , which they preſume to live five hundred yewes, and from the lives of Hawkes which (as Xlian wo ) the Agyptians doe reckon no lefle then at ſeven hun-

ceit ſo hard to be made out, that many have deſerted the common and | literall conſtruRtion. So Theon in Aratus would have the number: of nine not taken ſtriRly , but for many yeares : In other opinions the | compute {o farre excceded truth , thatthey have thought it more pro- | bableto takethe word Genea, that is a generationconſiſting of many | yeares, but for one yearc, or a ſingle revolution of the Sunne, which is the remarkable meaſure of time. and within the compaſle whereof we receive our perfeQion in the wombe. So that by this conſtruRion,the yeares of a Deere ſhould be but thirty 6x , as is diſcourſed at Jarge in| that Trad of Plutarch,concerning the ceſſation of Oracles,and where- | to in his Diſcourſe of the Crow, Aldrovandus alſo inclineth : others | not able to make it out, have rejected the whole account, as may bee | obſerved from the words of Plinie , Heſiodus qui primws aliquid de. longevitate vite prodidit , 'fabuloſe (reor) multa de hominum evo refe- | rence cornicl nevem noſtr as attribuit etates quadruplum ejus cervs, id tri-| plicatum corus , & reliqua fabuloſins de Phenice & nymphs ; and this how ſlender ſoever, was probably the ſtrongeſt ground Antiquity had | for this longzvity of Animalls, that made Theophraſtus expoſtulate | «ith Nature concerning the long life of Crows , that begat that Epi- thite of Deer -7paxsperos, in Oppianus , and that expreſſion of Juvenal —Longa CF cervina ſenetIas.
The third ground was Philoſophicall and founded upon a probable reaſon in nature, and that is the deteR of a Gall, which part (in the opi- nion of Ariſtotle and Plinie) this animall wanted, and was conceived a cauſe and reaſon of theirlong life , according (faythey) as it happe- neth unto ſome few men, who bave not this part at all; but this aflerti- on is firſt defeRive inthe verity concerning the animall alleadged : for though it be true, a Dcere hathnogall in the liver like many other ani- malls, yet hath it that part inthe guts as is diſcoverable by tafte and
colour : and therefore Plinie doth well corre himlelfe, when having affirmed before, it had no gall, he afterward ſaith, ſome hold it to bee inthe guts, and that for their bitterneſſe, dogs will refuſe to cat them. Ic is alſo deficient in the verity of the Indution or connumeration of other annimalls conjoyned herewith, as havingalſo no gall , that is, as Plinie accounteth, Zqui, Mvli.cc. Horſes, Mules, Aﬀes, Dcer,Goats, Boars, Camells, Dolphins, have nogall z concerning Horſes ,- what truth there is herein we have declared before , as for Goats wee finde not them without it , what gall the Camell hath, Ariſtotle declareth, that Hogs alſo have it, we can affirm,and that not in any obſcure place, but in the liver, even as it is ſeated in man.
That therefore the Deere is no ſhort lived animall, we will acknow- ledge, that comparatively, and in ſome ſenſe long lived wee will con- cede; and thus much we ſhall grant if we commonly account its dayes by thirty fix or forty , for thereby it will excced all other wag "1

Concerning the Deere there alſo paſſeth another opinion, that the males thereof doe yearly lole their pizzell; for men obſerving the de- cidence of their hornes , doe fall upon the like conceit of this part that it annually rofteth away, and ſucceffively reneweth againe. Now the
ground hereof , was ſurely the obſervation of this part in Deere after | immoderate venery, and about the cnd of their Rute, which ſometimes becomes ſo relaxed and pendulous , it cannot be quite retrafted ; and | being often beſet with flyes, it is conceived to rot , and at laſt to fall from the body ; but herein experience will contradie us : for thoſe Deere which either dye or are killed at that time, or any other , are al- waycs found to have that part entire; and reafon alſo will corre& us, for ſpermaticall parts , or ſuch as are framed fromthe ſeminall prin- ciples of parents, although eneous of fimilary, will not admita Regeneration , much lefſe will they receive an integrall reſtauration, which being organicall and inſtrumentall members,conſiſt of many of thoſe. Now this part, or animall of Plato, containeth not only ſangui- neous and reparable particles , but is made up of veynes, nerves, arte- | ries, and in ſome animalls of bones , whoſe reparation is nd its ' owne fertility, and a fruit not to be expected from the fraRi part

For unto reaſon it ſcemeth very repugnant, that a carcaſle or body 'diſanimated , ſhould be ſo affected with every wind, asto carry a con formablereſpc& and conſtant habitude thereto : For although in ſun- dry animalls, we devy not a kinde of naturall Aſtrologie,or innate pre. ſention both of wind and weather z yetthat proceeding from ſenſe re-| | ceiving imprefſi »as from the firſt mutation of the ayre, they cannotin reaſon reraine that apprehenſion afcer death, as being affcRions which depend on life, and depart upon diſanimation,and therefore with more favourable reaſon may we draw the ſame effect, or ſympathie upon the Hedgehog, whoſe preſention of winds is ſo exaR, that it ſtoppeth the north or ſoutherne hole of its neſt, according to prenotion of theſe winds enſuing, which ſome men unexpeRedly obſerving, have beene able to make predictions which way the wind would turne , and have | been eſteemed hereby wiſe men in point of weather. Now this pro-| | ceeding from ſenſe in the creature alive,it were not reaſonable to hang up an Hedgehog dead , and tocxpeR a conformable motion unto its livipg converſion : and though in ſundiy plants their vertues doe live after death , and we know-that Scammonie, Rhubarbe,and Senna will | purge without any vitall aſſiſtance; yet in animals or ſenſible creatures, | many a&ions are mixt, and depend upon their living forme, as well as that of miſtion, and though they wholly ſeeme to retaine unto the ho- dy depart upon diſunion : Thus Glowewormes alive, projeR a luſtie in the darke , which fulgour notwithſtanding ceaſeth after death; and thus the Torpedo which being alive ſtupifies at a diſtance, applied at- ter degth, produceth no ſuch effeR, which had they retained, in places where they abound, they might have ſupplyed Opium , and ſerved as / frontalls in Phrenfies. | As forcxperiment we cannot make it out by any we have attempted, for if a fangle Kingfiſher be hanged up with untwiſted filke in an open | roome , and where the ayre is free, it obſerves not a conſtant reſpeR unto the mouth of the wind , but variouſly converting doth ſcldome breaſt it right; if two be ſuſpended in the ſame roome, they will not regularly conforme their breaſts , bur oft-times reſpeR the oppoſite | pointsof heaven; and if we conceive that for the ex1R exploration they ſhould be ſuſpended where theayre is quiet and unmoved , that | clear of impediments,they may more frecly convert upon their naturall | verticity, we have alſo made this way of inquiſicion in ſuſpending | | them in large and capacious glaſſes cloſely ſtopped; wherein neverthe-  Icfle we obſerved a caſual ſtation,and that they reſted irregularly upon converſion , whereſoever they reſted remaining inconverted , and | poſſeſſing one point of the Compiſſe , whilſt the wind perhaps hath Commits | Pafled the two and thirty, | mftaken fox The groundof this popular pratice might be the common opinion the true | Concerning the vertue prognoſticke of thelc birds, the naturall regard | Halcion, | chey

Surely many things fall out by the D-figne of the generall motor and un- dreamt of contrivance of Nature, which are not imputable unto the intention or knowledge of the particular AFor.

So hath that bird beene taken for the Pharaix which liverh in Arabia, and buildeth its | neſt with Cinnamon, by Herodotus called Cinnama/gwe, and by Ari- ſtotle Cinnamomwue, and as a fabulous conceirt is cenſured by Scaliger ; | ſome have conceived that bird tobe the Phzaix, which by a Perſian name with the Greeks is called Rhyntacey, but how they made this good we finde occaſion of doubr, whilſt we reade inthe life of Artax- erxes, that this isa little bird brought often to their tables, and where- with Paryſatis cunningly poyſoned the Queene. The Manucodiata or bird of Paradiſe, hath had the honour of this game , and their fea- chers brought from the Molucca's, doc paſlc for thoſe of the Ph zaix , which though promoted by raricty with us , the Eafterne trayellers will hardly admir, who know they are common in thoſe parts, and the ordinary plume of Janizarics among the Turks. And laſtly, the bird | Semenda bath found the ſame appellation, for {0 hath Scaliger ob- ſaved and refuted; nor will the ſolicude of the Phan1x allow this de- nomination, for many there arc of that ſpecics,& whole trifiſtulary bill and crany we have beheld our ſclves ; nor are men onely at variance in | | regard of the Phznix it ſelfc, but very diſagrecing in the accidents aſcribed thereto : for ſome afficme it liveth three hundred, ſome five, others ſix, ſome a thouſand, others no lefle then fifteene hundred | yeares ; ſome ſay it liveth in Achiopia, others in Arabia, ſome in &- gypt, others in India, and ſome I chinke in Utopia, for ſuch muſt that be which is deſcribed by LaQtancius, that is, which neither was ſinged in the combuſtion of Phactgn, or overwhelmed by the inundation of Deucaleon. | Laftly, many Authors who have made mention hereof, have ſo de- livered themſelves , and with ſuch intentions we cannot from thence deduce a confirmation ; For ſome have written Poctically as Ovid, Mantuan, LaQantius, Claudian, and others : Some have written my- ſtically , as Paracelſus in his booke de 429th, or deligne & linea wite; and as feverall Hernmeticall Philoſophers, involving theicin the ſecret of their Eſixir , and enigmatically expreſſing the nature of their great - | worke : "Some have written Rhetorically, and conceſſively not contro- verting

As for longzvity, as that it liveth a thouſand yeares,or more, beſide that from imperfect obſervations and rarity of appearance, no confir- mation can be made,there may be probably a miſtake in the compute; for the tradition being very ancient and probably Agyptian, the Greeks who diſperſed the fable, might ſumme up the account by their owne numeration of yeares , whereas the conceit might have its origi- oall in times of ſhorter compute, for if we ſuppoſe our preſent calcu- lation,the Phenix now in nature will be the fixt from the Creation, but in the middle of its years, and if the Rabbines propheſic ſucceed ſhall conclude its dayes, not in its owne , butthe laſt and generall flames, without all hope of ReviviRion.

Cuay, XIII. Frogges, T oades,and Toad. ffone.
Oncerning the venemons urine of Toads, of the ſtone in a Toads | head, and of the generation of Frogpes , conceptions are enter- | tained which require conſideration; And firſt, that a Toad piſleth, and this way diffuſeth irs venome, is generally received, not onely with us, but alſo in other parts; for ſo hath Scaliger obſerved in his Comment, Averſum wrinam reddere ob oculos perſecutoris pernicioſam ruricols per- ſuaſam eft , and Mathiolus hath alſo apaſſage, that a Toad communi- cares its venom, not onely by vrine, but by the humiditie and ſlaver of its mouth ; which notwithſtanding ſtrialy underſtood , will not con- fiſt with truthz For to ſpeak properly,a Toad piſſeth not, nor doe they containe thoſe urinary parts which are found in other animals,to avoid that ſerous excretion, as may appeare unto any that exenterats or dif- ſe&s them; for therein will be found neither bladder, kidneyes, or ure- ters,any more then they are in birds, which although theyeat & drink, yet for the moiſt and dry excretion , have but one vent and common place of exclifion, and with the ſame proprictie of language, we may aſcribe that ation unto Crowes and Kites; and this is verified not only 1n Frogs and Toades,but for ought I can diſcover , that may bee true which Ariſtotle affirmeth , that no oviparous animall, that is, which either ſpawne or lay egges doth urine, except the Tortois. The ground or occaſion of this expreſſion might from hence ariſe, that
A— —
| Book 3. and Common Errors, 137 that Toades are ſometimes obſerved to exclude or ſpirt out a dark and liquid matter behinde, which indeed we have obſerved to be true,and 2 venemous conditionthere may bee perhaps therein, bur it cannot bee | called their urineznot onely becauſe they want thoſe parts of ſecretion, but becauſe it is emitted averſly or backward, by both ſexes.
As for the ſtone commonly called a Toad-ſtone,which is preſumed to be found inthe head of that animall, we firſt conceive it not a thing impoſſible, nor is there any ſubſtantiall reaſon, why in a Toade, there may not be found ſuch hard and lapideous concretions;for the like we
ily obſerve in the heads of fiſhes, as Codds, Carpes, and Pearches, the like alſo in Snailes, a ſoit and exofſcous animall, whereof in the na- ked and greater ſort, as though ſhe would requite the defeR of a ſhell on their back, nature neerethe head hath placed a flat white ſtone , or rather teſtaceous concretion which though Aldrovand affirms,that af- ter difſeQion of many, hee found but in ſome few, yet of the great gray Snailes, I have not met with any that wanted it, and the ſame is indeed ſo palpable,that without difſeRion it is diſcoverable by the hand. | Againe, though it be not impoſlible, yet is it ſurely very rare, as we | are induced to belceeve from ſome enquiry of our owne, from the triall | of many who have beene deceived, and the fruſtated ſearch of Porta, who upon the explorement of many, could never finde one; Nor is it | onely of rarity, but may be doubted whether it be of exiftency, or re- | ally any ſach ſtone in the head of a Toad at all : For although lapida- | ries, and queſtuary.enquirers affirme it, yet the Writers of Mineralls | and naturall ſpeculators , are of another beliefe conceiving the ſtones | which beire this name, to be a Minerall concretion, norto be found in animalls, but in fields, and therefore Beetims de Boot referres it to Aﬀte- | - - | ria,or ſome kindeof Zapis felaris, and plainely concludeth , Reperian- Iur in agris , quts tamen alit in anueſis , ac qui dis in Arundinetss , in- | ter rubos ſenteſque delitnerunt bufons capuibus generari pertinaciter af-

Concerning the generation of Froggs, wee ſhall briefly deliver that account which'obſcrvation hath taught us. By Frogpes I underſtand not ſuch as ariſing from putritaRion,are bred without copulation , and becauſe they ſubſiſt not long, are called Temporarie z nor doe I meane hereby the little Frogge of an excellent Parrat-green , that uſually ſits | ON trees and buſhes , and is therefore called Ravwnceulus viridis, or Ar-
bortas; but hereby I underſtand the aquatile or water Frogge whereof \ in ditches and ſtanding plaſhes, wee may behold many millions every | Spring in England z Now theſe doe not as Plinic conceiveth, exclude blacke pieces of fleſh, which after become Frogges , but they let fall their ſpawne in the water , which is of excellent uſe in Phyficke, and {carce unknowne unto any; in this ſpawne of alentous and tranſparent body, are to be diſcerned many gray ſpecks , or little conglobations, which in a little time become of deepe blacke; a ſubſtance more com- paced and terreſtrious then the other , for it riſeth not in diſtillation, and affords a powder, when the white and aqueous part is exhaled. Now of this blacke or duskie ſubſtance is the Frogge at laſt formed, as we have beheld, including the ſpawne with water 1n aglaſſe,and ex- | poſing it unto the Sunne for that blacke and round ſubſtance, ina few dayes began to dilate and grow ovall, after a while the head, the eyes, the taile to be diſcerneable, and at laſt to become that which the An-, cients called Gyrinus , wee a Porwigle or Tadpole, and this in ſome weekes after, becomes a perfeR Fropge, the legs growing out before, and the tayle wearing away, to ſupply the other behinde, as may bee | obſerved in ſome, which have newly forſaken the water: for in ſuch, ſome part of the tayle will be ſeen but curtal'd and ſhort, not long and fiany as beforey a part provided them a while to ſwim and move in the water, that is, untill ſuch time as nature excluded legs, whereby they might be provided not only to ſwim inthe water, but moveupon the | | land,according to the amphibious and mixt intention of nature, that is [to live in both. And becauſe many affirme, and ſome deliver , that in
regard it hath lungs and breatheth a Frogge may bee cafily drowned, though the reaſon be probable, I finde not the experiment anſwerable, for making triall,and faftning one about a ſpan under water, it lived al- moſt fix dayes. |

An animall (ſaith he) ſo cold that ir ex- cioguiſheth the fire like Ice 3 all which notwithſtanding,there is on the | negative Authoritie and experience; Sextins a Phyſition,as Plinic deli- vereth,denicd this effeR, Dioſcorides affirmed ita point of folly to be- | leeve it, Galen that it endurcth the fire a while , bur in continuance is | conſumed therein; For experimentall conviction Mathiolus affirmeth, he ſaw a Salamander burnt in a very ſhort time; and of the like afferti- on is Amatus Luficanus , and moſt plainly Pierius, whoſe words in his | Hieroglyphicks are theſe ; Whereas it is commonly ſaid , that a Sala- | mander extinguiſherh fire , wee have found by experience, that 'tis ſo farre from quenching hot coales; that it dicth immediatly therein; As for the contraty aflertion of Ariſtotle,it is but by heareſay,as com- mon opinion belceverh , Hec enim (ut aiunt) ignem ingrediens eum ex- tingeis; and therefore there was no abſurdity 10 Galen when as a Sep- ticall medicine he commended the aſhes of a Salamander, and Magi cians in vaine fromthe power of this tradition, at the burning ot crowns | or houlcs expeR a xcliefe from Salamanders,
The ground of this opinion might be ſome ſenſible reſiſtance of fire obſerved inthe Salamander , which being as Galen determineth, cold inthe fourth, and moiſt in the third degree, and having alſo a nu- cous humidity above and under the skinne , by vertue thereof may a while endure the flame , which being conſumed it can reſiſt no more, Such an humidity there is obſerved in Newrtes,or water- Lizards.cſpe- cially if cheir skinnes be prickt or perforated, Thus will Frogges and Snailes endure the flame, thus will whites of egges, vitreous or glaſſcy flegme ex-inguiſh a coal,thus arc unguents made which proteR a while from the fice, and thus beſide the Hirpini , there are later ſtories of men that have paſs'd untoucht through fire, and therefore ſome trueth weallow in the tradition; truch according unto Galen, that it may for atime reſiſt a fl1me,or as Scaliger avers, extinguiſh or pur out a coale; for thus much will many humide bodies perfo.me , but that it perſe- veres and lives in that deſtruRive clement, is a t2llacious enlargement, nor doe we reaſonably conclude, becauſe for a time it endureth fire, it ſubdueth and extinguiſhech the ſame, becauſe by a cold and aluminous moiſture,ir is able a while to reſiſt ir, from a peculiaricy of nature it ſubfaſteth and liveth in it. | |
Ic hath beetie much promoted by Stories of incombuſtible napkins and textures which endure the fire , whoſe materialls are c:1l'd by the nameof Saiamanders wooll; which many too literally apprehending, conceive ſome inveſting part, or tegument of the Salamander,wherein beſide that they miftake the condition of this animal, which is a kinde of Lizard, a quadruped corticated and depilous, that is without wooll,
furre, or haire , they oblerve not the method and general! rule of na- Ti 1 ture,

Nor is this Salamanders wooll deſumed from any animal, but a Mi- nerall ſubſtance Metaphorically ſo called from this received opinion; For beſide Germanicus his heart,and Pyrrhus his great Toe, there ate inthe number of Mineralls, ſome bodies incombuſtible;,more remark- ably that which the Ancients named Asbeſton, and Pancirollus ereats of inthe chapter of Linum vivem: whereof by Art were wes- ved napkins, ſhirts, and coats inconſumable by fire,and wherein in an- cient times,to preſerve their aſhes pure, and without commixture, they burnt the bodies of Kings z a napkin hereof Plinie reports that Nero | had,8: the like ſaith Paulus Venetus,theEmperour of Tartarie ſent uato Pope Alexander, and affirms that in ſome parts of Tartarie,there were | Mines of Iron whoſe filaments were weaved into ineombuſtible cloth, which rare manufaQure,although delivered for loſt by Pancirollus, yer Salmuth delivereth in his comment that one Podocaterus 2 prian, had ſhewedthe ſame at Venice, and his materialls were from Cyprus, where indeed Dioſcorides placeth them;the ſame is alſo ocularly con- firmed by Vives upon Auſtin and Maiolus in his colloquies, and thus in our daies do men praQiſe to make Jong laſting Snaſts or Elychinons parts for lampes,out of Alumen plumoſum; and by the ſame wee read | in Pauſanias , that there alwayes burnt a Lampe before the Image of

Cn4a9 3 Vo Of the Amphizbena,
Jin the Amphisbna, that is, a ſmaller kinde of Serpent, which moveth torward and backward, hath two heads , or one at cither extreame, was affirmed firſt by Nicander , and after bPmany others, by the Author of the book de Theriaca ad Piſonem, aſcribed unto Ga- len, more plainly Pliny, Geminum habet caput, tanquam parum eſſet wno ore eff undi venenum : but Alian moſt contidemly , who referring the conceit of Chimera and Hydra unto fables , hath ſet downethis as an undeniable truth.
Whereunto while men aſſent, and can beleeve a bicipitous confor- mation in any continued ſpecies, they admit a gemination of principall parts, which is not y diſcovered in any animall, true it is that other parts in animals are not equall , for ſome make their progreſſion |

And were there any ſuch ſpecies or naturall kinde of animall, it would be hard to make good thoſe ſix poſitions of body , which ac- cording to the three dimenſions are aſcribed unto every animall, that is, infra, ſupra, ame, retro, dextrorſum, ſiniftrorſum, for if (as it is deter- mined ) that be the anterior and upper part wherein the ſences are pla- ced, and that the poſterior and lower part which is oppoſite thereunto, there is no inferiour or former part in this animall, for the ſenſes be- ing placed at both extreames , doe make both ends anteriour, which is impoſſible , the termes being Relative, which mutually ſubfiſt , and are not without each other, and therefore this duplicity was ill contri- ved to place one head at both extreames,and had beene more tolerable to have ſetled three or foure at one, and therefore alſo Paects have been more reaſonable then Philoſophers, and Geryon or Cerberus, leſſe monſtrous then Amphisbena.
Apaine, it any ſuch thing there were, ic were not to be obtruded by the name of Amphisbzna, or as an animall of one denomination, for-
operly that animall is not one , but multiplicious or many , which bath a duplicity or gemination of principle parts ; and this doth Ari- ſtotle define , when he afficmeth a monſter is to be eſteemed one or | many, according to its principle, which he conceived thehexrt, whence he derived the originall of Nerves, and thereto aſcribe many aQs ' which Phyſitiansaffigne unto the braine ; and therefore if it cannat be called ote, which hath a duplicity of hearts in his ſence , it cannot re- ceive that appellation with a plurality of heads in ours, And this the \ praRtiſe of Chriſtians hath acknowledged , who have baptized theſe geminous births, and double connaſcencies with ſeverall names , as | conceiving in them a diſtinRion of ſoules, upon the devided execution of their funRions z that is, while one wept, the other laughing, while one was filent, the other ſpeaking, while one awaked, the other ſleep- : ihg, as is declared by three remarkable examples in Petrach, Vincenti- us, and the Scottiſh hiſtory of Buchanan,

womb and belly of the female is a very ancient tradition; in this ſence entertained inthe Hieroglyphicks of the Agyptians,affirmed by Hero- dotus, Nicander, Pliny, Plutarch, A&lian, Jerome, Baſil, Ifidore, and: | ſeems to be countenanced by Ariſtotle,and his ſcholler Theophraſtus, from hence is commonlyaſſigned the reaſon why theRomans puniſhed parricides by drowning them in a ſack with a Viper;and ſo perhaps up- onthe ſame opinion the men of Melita when they ſaw a viper upon the hand of Paul,ſaid preſently without conceit of any other fin, No doubt this man is a murtherer, whom though he have eſcaped the Sea,yet ven. | geance ſuffereth him not to live; that is, he is now paid in his own way, the parricidous animall and puniſhment of Murtherers is upon himzand though the Tradition were currant among the Greekes to confirme the { fame the Latine naine is introduced,Y ipers quaſi vipariat; That paſſage alſo inthe Goſpell, O yee generation of Vipers, hath found expoſiti- ons which countenance this conceit ; notwithſtanding which authori- ties, tranſcribed relations and conjeRures , upon enquiry we finde the ſame repugnant unto experience and reaſon.
And feſt it ſeemes not only injurious unto the providence of Nature, to ordaine a way of produRtion which ſhould deſtroy the producer, or contrive the continuation of the ſpecies by the deſtruction of the conti- nuator;but it overthrowes and fruſtrates the great Benediion of God, | which is expreſſed Gen.1. God bleſſed them ſaying, Be fruitfull and multiply. Now if it be ſo ordained that ſome muſt regularly periſh by multiplication , and theſe bethe fruits of frucifying inthe Viper, | it cannot be ſaid that God did blefſe, but curſe this animall ; upon thy
belly ſhalt thou goe, and duſt ſhalt thou cat all thy life,was not ſo great a puniſhment unto the Serpent after the fall,as encreaſe, be fruitfull and multiply , was before. This were to confound the malediRions of God, andtranſlate the curſe of the Woman upon the Serpent ; that is, in dolore paries, in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth , which being proper unto the women, is verified beſt in the Viper,whoſe delivery is not only accompanied with paine,bur alſo with death it ſelf. And laſtly,it over- throws the carefull courſe, and parentall proviſion of nature, whereby | the young ones newly excluded are ſuſtained by the Dam, and prote- | Qed untill they grow up to a ſufficiencie for themſelves, all which is perverted in this eruptive generation , forthe;Dam being deſtroyed, the younglings are left to their owne proteRion, which is not conceive- | able they canat all performe, and whereof they afford us a remarkable confirmance many dayes after birth 5 forthe young ones ſuppoſed to | | breake through the belly of the Dam, will upon any fright for proteRi- | on run into it;for then the old one receives them in at her mouth, which | way the fright being paſt they will returne againe; which is a peculiar way of refuge; and though it ſeem ſtrange is avowed by frequent ex- perience, and undeniable teſtimony.

As for the Latin word Yipera, which in the Erymologie of Ifidore promoterh this conceit , more properly it may imply vivipers; for whereas other Serpents lay FS, the Viper excluderh living animalls, and though the Ceraſtes be alſo viviparous, and we have found formed Snakes inthe belly of the Cecilia or flow-worme , yet may the Viper emphatically beare that name; for the notation or Etymologie is not of necefſicy adequate unto the name; and thereforethough animall be de- duced trom anime , yet are there many animations beſide , and plants will challenge a right therein as well as ſenſible creatures,

Book 3. and Common Errors.”
As for the mutation of ſexes, or tranſicion into one another, we can- | not deny it in Hares , it being obſervable inman : for hereof befide | | Empedocles or Tirefias, there are not a few examples; and though ve- | ry few,or rather none which have emaſculated or turned women, yet very many who from an eſteem or reallity of being women have in- | fallibly proved men: ſomeat thefirſt point of their menſtruous erupti- | ons, ſome in the day of their marriage,others many yeares after,which | occaſioned diſputes at Law, and conteftations concerning a reſtore of the dowry ; and that not only mankinde , but many other animalls, may ſuffer this tranſexion, we will not deny,or hold it at al impoſſible although I confefle by reaſon of the poſticke and backward poſition of the feminine parts in quadrupeds, they can hardly admit the ſubſti- | eution of a protruſion effeuall unto maſculine generation, except it be | in Retromingents, and ſuch as couple backward.
Nor ſhall we only concedethe ſucceſſion of ſexes in ſome, but ſhall not diſpute the tranſition of reputed ſpecies in others ; thar is, a tranl- | mutation, or (as Paracelſians terme it) the Tranſplantation of one into | another; hereof in perteR animalls of a congenerous ſeed, or neare afhi- | nity of natures, examples are not unfrequent, as Horſes, Aſſes, Dogs, Foxes, Phaiſants, Cocks, 8c. but in imperfect kindes,and ſuch where the diſcrimination of ſexes is obſcure, theſe transformations are more common: and in ſome within themſclves without commixtion, as par-
ticularly in Caterpillers or Silk-wormes, wherein there is viſible and [triple transfiguration : but in Plants wherein there is no diſtinRion of ſex , theſe transplanrations are yet more obvious thenany z as that of barley into oates, of wheat into darnell, and thoſegraines which gene- | rally ariſe among corne, as cockle, Aracus, Zgilops, and other dege- nerations which come up in unexpected ſhapes , when they want the ſupport and maintenance of the primary and maſter-formes : And the ſame do ſome affirm concerning other plants in leſſe analogy of figures, as the mutation of Mint into Creſles, Bafill into Serpoile, and Turhgps into Radiſhes; in all which as Severinus conceiverh there may be cqui- yocall ſeeds and Hermaphroditicall principles,which contain the radi- cality and power of different formes;thus in the ſeed of wheat there ly- eth obſcurely the ſeminality of Darnell,although in a ſecondary or in- feriour way, and at ſome diſtance of produQion; which nevertheleſſe if it meet with convenient promotion, ora conflux and conſpiration of | cauſes more powerfull then the other , it then beginneth to edifice in chiefe,and contemning the ſuperintendent forme,produceth the figna- |
tures of its ſelfe.
Now therefore alchough we deny not theſe ſeverall mutations, and doe allow that Hares may exchange their ſex , yet this we conceive doth come to paſſe but ſometimes,and not in that viciffitude or annuall alternation as is preſumed; that is, from imperfeRion to perfeRion, from T 2 per-

tion of ſex is only ſo in opinion, and that theſe transfeminated perſons were really men at firſt, although ſucceeding yeares produced the ma- nifeſto or evidence of their virilities ; which although intended and formed, was not at firſt excluded , and that the examples hereof have undergone no reall or new tranſcxion, but were Androgynally borne, and under ſome kind of Hermaphrodites : for though Galen do favour the opinion, that the diſtinRive parts of ſexes are onely different inpo- fiction, that is inverſion or protruſion, yet will this hardly be made out from the Anatomy of thole parts , the teſticles being ſo ſeated in the female that they. admit not of protruſion , and the necke of the matrix wanting thoſe parts which are diſcoverable inthe organ of virility. The ſecond and moſt received acception, is,that Hares arc male and female by conjunRion of both ſexes, and ſuch are found in mankinde, Poetically called He1maphrodites, ſuppoſcd to be formed from the equality, or ox vidforie of either ſeed , carrying about them the parts of man and woman; although with great variety in perfeRion, ſite and ability ; not only as Ariſtotle conceived, with a conſtant impoten- cic in one; but ah Odſervers afhcme,fometimes with ability of ci- ther venery: and therefore the providence of ſoine Laws have thought £009, that atthe yeares of maturity, they ſhould cle one ſex, and the errors in the other ſhould ſuffer a ſeverer puniſhment; whereby endea- vouring to prevent incontinencie , they unawares enjoyned perpetuall chaſtity; for being executive in both parts, and confined unto one,they reſtrained a naturall power , and ordained a partiall virginity. Plato and ſome of the Rabbines proceeded higher , who conceived the firſt man an Hermaphrodite;and Marcus Leo the learned Jew,in ſome ſenſe hath allowed it, affirming that Adam in one ſuppoſitum without divi- fion, contained both male and female; and therefore whereas it is ſaid in the Text, that God created man in his owne Image, in the Image of God created he him, male and female created he them, applying the ſingular and plurall unto Adam, it might denote that in one ſubſtance,
and in himſelfc he included both ſexes which was after divided, and the

the female called Woman. The opinion of Ariſtotle extendeth far- ther , from whoſe aſſertion all men ſhould be Hermaphrodices , for | affirming that women do not ſpermatize,and conferreg place or recep: | tacle rather then efſentiall principles of generation, he deduively in- / cludes both ſexes in mankinde ; for fromthe father procecd not only | males and females , but from himalſo muſt Hermaphroditica!l and | maſculo-feminine generations be derived , and a commixtion of both | ſexes ariſe from the ſced of one : But the Schoolmen have dealt with | that ſex more hardly then any other , who though they have not much | diſputed their generatien,yet have they controverted their ReſurreRi- | on, and rayſed a query whether any atthe laſt day ſhould ariſc in the | ſex of women, as may be obſerved in the ſupplement of Aquinas.
Now as we inuſt acknowleage this Andiogynall condition in man, ſo can we not deny the like doth happen in beaſts. Thus doe we read in Plinic that Neroes Chariot was drawne by foure Hermaphroditicall Mares, and Cardan affirmes he alſo beheld one at Antwerpe; and thus may we alſo concede, that Hares have been of both ſexes, and ſome | have ocularly confirmed it; but that the whole ſpecies or kinde ſhould be biſexous we cannot affirme , who have found the parts of male and female reſpectively diſtin and fingle in any wherein we have enqui- red ; and whereas 1t is conceived, that being an harmleſle animall and deleQable food unto man, nature hath madethem with double ſexes, | and that aRively and paſhvely performing they might more numerouſ. ly encreaſe 3 we forget an higher providence of nature whereby ſhee eſpecially promotes the multiplication of Hares , which is by ſuperfe- cation; that is, 2 conception upon 2 conception, or an improvement of a ſecond fruit before the firſt be excluded, preventing hereby the uſuall intermiſſion and vacant time of generation, which is very common and frequently obſervable in Hares , mentioned long agoe by Ariſtotle, Herodotus, and Pliny z and we have often obſerved that after the firſt caſt, there remaine ſucceſſive conceptions, and other younglings very immature, and far from their terme of excluſion.
Nor need any man to queſtion this in Hares, for the ſame wee ob- ſerve doth ſometime happen in womenzfor although it be true that up- on conception, the inward orifice of the matrix exadly cloſeth, ſorhat | it commonly admitteth nothing after; yet fallerh it out ſometime, that inthe a of coition, the avidity of that part dilateth it ſelfe, and recei- | veth a ſecond burden , which if it happen to be neare in time unto the firſt, they commonly doe both proceed unto perfeRion,and have legi- | timateexcluſions, and periodically ſucceed each other ': but if the perfetation be made with conſiderable intermiſhon, the latter moſt commonly proves abortive for the firſt being confirmed, engroſfeth the aliment fromthe other : However therefore the projet of Julia

paſſengers , before ſhe bad taken in her lading , there was a fallibility chercinznor indeed any abſolute ſecuritic in the policy of adultery after conception 3 for the Matrix (which ſome have called another animall within us, and which is not ſubjeRed untothe law of our will ) after ceception of its proper Tenant, may yet receive a ſtrange and ſpurious inmate, as is confirmable by many examples in Plinie, by Lariſſza in Hippocrates , and that merry one in Plautus urged alſo by Ariſtotle, that 1s of Iphicles and Hercules, the one begat by Jupiter,the other by | Amphitryonupon Alcmzna as allo inthoſe ſuperconceptions where | one childe was like the father,the other like the adulterer , the one fa- your'd the ſcrvant,the other reſembled the maſter.
Now the grounds that begat ,or much promoted the opinion of a double ſex 1n hares might bee ſome little bags or tumors , at firſt glance repreſenting ſtones or Teſticles , to be found in both ſexes a- boutthe parts of generation; which men obſerving in either ſex, were induced to belecve a maſculine ſex in both; but to ſpeak properly theſe A are 00 Teſticles or parts afficiall unto generation , but glandulous ſub-
— ſtances that ſeeme to hold the nature ot EmunRories ; for herein may be perceived ſlender perforations, at which may be expreſled a blacke and {ceculent matter; if therefore trom theſe we ſhall conceive a mixti- on of ſexes in Hares, with fairer reaſon we may conclude it in Bevers, whereof both ſexes containe a double bagge or tumor in the groine, commonly called the Cod of Caſtor, as we have delivered before.
Another ground were certaine holes or cavities obſerveable about the fiedge; which being perceived in males, made ſome conceive there might be alſo a ſxminine nature inthem , and upon this very ground, the ſame opinion hath paſſed upon the Hyzna , as is declared by Ari- | ſtotle,and thus tranſlated by Scaligerz; Quod autem atunt utriuſq; ſexus habere genitalia falſum eſt quod videtur eſſe feminenm ſub cauda, eſt ſi- mile figura feminino verum pervinum non eſt;and thus is it alſo in Hares,
in whom theſe holes, although they ſeeme to make adeepe cavity, yet [doe they not perforate the skin , nor hold a community with any part | of generation , but were ( as Plinie delivereth ) eſteemed the marks of their age, the number of thoſe decyding their number of yeares; what verity there is herein, we ſhall not contend ; for if in other ani- mals there be authentick notations, if the charaRers of yeares be found in the hornes of Cowes, or inthe Antlers of Deere, if we conjecture the age of Horſes from joynts in their dockes,and undeniably preſume | » from their tecthz we cannot affirme, there is in their conceit, any [affront unto nature , although, who ever cnquireth ſhall finde no affu- ANCE therein, /

no further need of eyes then to avoid the light,and to be ſenfible when ever they loſt that darkeneſle of earth , which was their naturall con- finement; and therefore however Tranſlators doe render the word of | Ariſtotle, or Galen, that is, #mper/edos, obleſos, or inchoatos , it is not
much conſiderable z for their cyes are ſufficiently begun to finiſhthis | action and competently pertcR, for this imperfeR Viſton.
And laftly, although they had neither eyes nor ſight, yet could they not be termed blinde; for blindeneſſe being a privative terme unto fight, this appellation is not admittible in propriety of ſpeech, and
| willoverthrow the doQtine of privations , which preſuppoſe poficive formes or habits, and are not indefinite negations, denying in all ſub. jeRs but ſuch alone wherein the poſitive habits are intheir proper na ture, and placed without repugnancy. So do we improperly ſay a Moll is blinde, if we deny it the organs or a capacity of viſion from its crea- ted nature; ſo when the Text of John had ſaid, that man was blinde from his nativity, whoſe cecity our Saviour cured, it was not warran- table in Nonnus to ſay he had noeyesat all, as he deſcriberh in his pa- raphraſe, and as fomeancient Fathers affirme, that by this miracle they were created in him and ſo though the ſence may be accepted , hy prover

Now this conceit is ereRted upon a miſapprehenfion or miſtake in the ſymptomes of viſion, men confounding aboliſhment , diminution and depravement, and naming that anabolition of fight, which indeed is but an abatement. For if viſion be aboliſhed, it is called cecites, or blindneſle, if depraved and receive its objes erroneouſly, Hallucina- tion, if dimiſhed, hebetudo viſas, caligatio, or dimneſſe ; now inſtead of a diminution or imperfect vifion in the Moll , we affirme an abolition or totall privation, in ſtead of caligatioh or dimnefle , wee conclude a cecity or blindnefle , which hath beene frequently committed con- cerning other animals ; ſo ſome affirme the water Rat is blinde,ſo Sam- monicus and Nicander do call the Muſ-Araneus the ſhrew or Ranoy, blinde; And becauſe darkeneffe was before light,the Agyptians wor- ſhipped the ſame: So are \low- Wormes accounted blinde,and the like we aftirme proverbially of the Beetle, although their eyes be evident, and they will flye againſt lights, like many other inſeQs , and though alſo Ariſtotle determines , that the eyes are apparent in all flying in- ſes, though other ſenſes be obſcure, and not perceptible at all ; and if from a diminution wee tay inferre a totall privation , or affirme that other animals are blinde which doe not acutely ſee or comparatively unto others, wee ſhall condemne unto blindenefle many not ſo eſtee- med; for ſuch as have corneous or horney eyes, as Lobſters and cru- ſtaceous animals, are generally dim ſighted, all inſes that have «»- tenne, or long hornes to feele out their way, as Butter-flies and Lo- cuſts, or their fore legs ſo diſpoſed , that they much advance _ their heads , as may be obſerved in Spiders; and if the Agle were | judge, wee might be blinde our ſelves, the expreſſion therefore of Scripture inthe ſtory of Jacob is ſurely with circumſpeRion , And it

any. animall, that is, one of each fide, according ta the divition of the
in one place; for the two extremes would ſufficiently performe the office of ſight without the help of the intermediate eyes, and be- hold as much as all ſeven joyned together, for the viſible baſe of the objec would be defined by theſe two, and the middle eyes although they behold the ſame thing, yet could they not behold ſo muchthere- of astheſe; ſo were it no adv unto man to have a third eye be- eweene thoſe two he hath already ; and the fiion of Argus ſeemes more reaſonable then this; for though he had many eyes, yer were they | placed incircumterence and poſitions of advantage.
Againe, theſe cavities which men call eyes arc ſeated out of the head, and where the Gils of other fiſh arc placed , containing no or- | | gans of fight, nor having any communication with the braine ; now all ſenſe proceeding from the braine, and that being placed (as Galen ob- ſerveth) in the upper part of the body , for the fitter ſituation of the eyes, and convenienicy required unto ſight, it js not reaſonable to ima- | gine that they arc any whereelle, or deſervethat name which are ſea- red in other parts ; and therefore we relinquiſh as fabulous what is de»  livered of Sternopthalmi, or men with eyes in their breaſt; and when it
is ſaid by Solomon, A wiſe mans eyesare in his head , it is to be taken in ſecond ſence, and affordeth no objeRion : True it is that the eyes of animals are ſeated with ſome diffc1ence,butall whatſoever in the head, and that more forward then the eare or hole of hearing. In quadru- pedes, in regard of the figure of their heads, they are placed at ſome diſtance, in latiroſtrous and fAlat-bild birds they arc more laterally ſea- ted; and therefore when they looke intently they turne one eye upon | the objeR, and can convert their heads to ſee before and behitncde, and
to behold two oppoſite points at once 3 but at a more eafie diſtance are they fituated in man, and inthe ſame circumference with the care, for | if one foote of the compaſſe be placed upon the Crowne, a circle deſcribed thereby will interſeQ, or paſſe over both the eares.
The error in this conceit conſiſts in the ignorance of thele cavities, and their proper uſe in nature; for this is a particular diſpoſure of parts, and a peculiar conformation whereby theſe holes and fluces ſupply the defeR of Gils, and are aſſiſted by the conduit inthe head z for like ce- taceous animals and Whales, the L1mprey hath a fiſtula ſpout or pipe at the back part of the head , whereat they ſpirt out water: Nor is it onely fingular in this formation, but alſo in many other , as in defeR of bones, whereof it hath not one , and for the ſpine or back-bone , a cartilagineous ſubſtance without any ſpondyles, procefles, or protube- rance whatſoever as alſo in the provifion which Nature hath made forthe heart, which in this animall is very ſtrangely ſecured , andlyes immured in a cartilage or griſtly ſubſtance ; and laſtly, in the _—

GH a% XX | Of Snayles. |
T Hat Snayles haye two eyes, and atthe end of their hornes , beſide | the aſſertion of the people , is the opinion of- ſome learned men \ which notwithſtznding Scaliger tearmes but imitationof eyes, which Pliny contradiRs,and Ariſtotle upon conſequence denyes,when he af-
firmes that teſtacgous animals have no cyes at all ; And for my owne
part after much inquiry, I am not ſatisfied that theſe are eyes, or that
thoſe black and atramentous ſpots which ſeeme to repreſent them are
any ocular reallities ; for if any objeR' be preſented unto them,
will ſometime ſceme to decline it, and ſometime run againſt it, if alſo | theſe black extremities, or oenates eyes be clipped off, they will not-
withſtanding make uſe of their protrufions or hornes, and poke out their way as before : Againe, if they were eyes or inſtruments of vifi- | on, they would have their originals in the head , and from thence de- | rive their motive and optick organs, but their roots and firſt extremi- ties are ſeared low upon the ſides of the back , as may be perceived in the whiter ſort of Snayles when they retrat them: And laſtly, if wee concede they have two eyes, ' wee muſt alſogrant , they have no leſſe [then foure, for not onely the two greater extenſions above have theſe imitations of eyes, but alſo the two lefler below,as is evident unto any, and if they be dextrouſly diſſeRed, there will be found on cither ſide | two black filaments or membranous ſtrings which extend into the long and ſhorter cornicle upon protrufion, and therefore if they have two eyes, they have alſo foure, which will be monſtrous, and beyond } the affirmation of any.
Now the reaſon why we name theſe black ſtrings eyes , is becauſe we know not what to call themelſc , and underſtand not the proper uſe of that part , -which indeed is very obſcure, and not delivered by any, but may probably be ſaid to affiſt the protruhon,and retraRion'ot their hornes, which being a weake and hollow body, require ſome in- ward eſtabliſhment, to confirme the length of their advancement, which we obſerve they cannot extend without the concurrence here- of ; for if with your finger you apprehend the top of the horne, and draw out this black, and membranous emiflion, the horne will be cx- cluded no more; bur if you clip off the extremity,or onely ſindge the top thereof with 4qus forts , or other corroſive water, leaving a con-
—_ part bchinde, they will neverthelefſe exclude their _— | V2 an

and therewith exploeate their way as before; and indeed the exaR ſenſe of theſe extremitics is very remarkable ; for if you dip a pen in Aqua fortis, oyle of vitriol, or Turpentine , and preſent it towards theſe points, they will at a reaſonable diſtance, decline the acrimony thereof, retyring or diſtorting them to avoid it ; and this they will nimbly performe if objeRed to the extremes, but ſlowly or not at all, if approached unto their rootes.
What hath beene therefore delivered concerning the plurality, pay. city, or anomalous fituation of eyes, is cither monſtrous, fabulous, or under things never ſcene includes good ſenle or meaning : and ſo may we reccive the figment of Argas, who was an Hicroglyphick of hea- ven, in thoſe centuries of eyes cxprefſing the ſtars, and their alternate wakings, the viciſſicude of day and night z which ſtriQtly taken cannot be admitted, for the ſubje& of ſleep is not the cye, butthe common ſenſe, which once aſleep, all eyes muſt be at reſt: And cherefore what is delivered as an Embleme of vigilancy , that the Hare and Lion doe {lcep with one eye open, doth not cvince they are aty moreawake then it they were both cloſed ; for the open eye beholds in ſleepe no more chen that which is cloſed, and no more one eye in them then two in 0- cher animals that ſleep with both open, as ſome by diſcaſe, and others naturally which have no eye lids at all. |
As for Polyphemus althongh his ſtory be fabulous, the monſtrofi- ty is not impoſlible ; for the aQ of Viſion may be performed with one eye, and inthe deception and fallacy of fight, hath this advantage of two, that it beholds not objeQs double, or ſecs two things for one ; for this doth happen when the axis of the viſive coves, diffuſed from | the obje&, fall not uponthe ſame plane , but that which is conveyed intoone eye, is more depreſled or elevated then that which enters the other. So if beholding a candle we protrudecither upward or downe- ward the pupill of one eye, the objeR will appeare double ; but if wee 'f ſhntthe other cyc, and behold ic but with one, it will then appeare bur ſingle, and if we abduce the eye unto either corner, the objcR will not duplicate, for in that poſition the axes of the coves remaine in the ſame plane, as is demonſtrated in the opticks, and delivered by Galen, in his tenth De uſs partium. | |
Relations alſo there are of men that could make themſelves inviſi- ble, which belongs not to this diſcourſe, but may ſerve as notable ex- preſſions of wiſe and prudent men, who fo contrive their affaires, that although their aRions be manifeſt, their deſignes are not diſcoverable: in this acccption there is nothing left of doubt, and Giges ring remai- neth ſtill among us z for vulgar cyes behold no more of wiſe men then doth the Sun, they may diſcover their exteriour and outward wayes, but their interiour and inward pieces he onely ſces, that ſees beyond their beings.

(acne the Chameleon there generally paſſeth an opinion |
ment z Thus much is in plaine termes affirmed by Solinus, Pliny, and divers other , and by this periphrafis is the ſame deſcribed by Ovid , Ay which notwithſtanding upon enquiry, I finde the aſſertion mainly controvertible , and very much to taile inthe three inducements of belicfe.
And firſt for its verity, although aſſerted by ſome, and traditionally delivered by others, yet is it very queſtionable. For befide Zlian,whe is ſeldome defeRive in theſe accounts; Ariſtotle diftinRly creating hereof, hath made no mention of this remarkeable propriety ; which
for that he remained ignorant of this account it is not eaſily conicei-
Some have poſitively denyed it, as Auguft:nne , Niphus, Stobems, Da- les ws, Fortunius, Licetws, with many more, others have i
that it liveth onely upon ayre , and is ſuſtained by no other ali- |
either ſuſpeRing irs verity, or preſuming its falſity hee ſurely omitted ; vable, it being the common opinion, and generally received by all men:
mentally refuted it, as namely 79hanzes Landiue, who inthe relation of Scaliger, obſerved a Chameleon to lick up a flye from his breaſt , But Bellonizs hath beene more ſatisfaRorily experimentall , not onely af- firming they feede on Flyes, Caterpillgrs, Beetles, and other inſecs, but upon exenteration he found theſe animals in their bellies z and al- though we have not had the advantage of our owne obſervation, yet have we received the like confirmation from many ocular ſpeators. Astouching the veriſimility or probabletruth of this relation, ſeve- rall reaſons there are which ſeeme to overthrow it ; For firſt, there are
found in this animall, theguts, the ſtomack , and other parts officiall
unto nutrition , which were its aliment the empty reception of _ their proviſions had beene ſuperfluous ; Now the wiſdome of Nature
abhorring ſuperfluities, and effeRing nothing in vaine, unto the inten- tion of theſe operations, reſpeRively contrivech the organs ; and there- fore where we finde ſuch Inſtruments. wee may with ſtrineſſe expeR their aRions, and where wediſcover them not, wee may with ſafety conclude the non-intention of their operations: So when we obſerve that oviperous animals , as Lizards, Frogs, Birds, and moſt Fiſhes have neither bladder nor kidnies, we may with reaſon inferre they do
not urine at all : Bur whereas in this ſame kinde we diſcover theſe parts
inthe Tortoys beyond any other , wee cannot deny he exerciſeth that
excretion z Nor was there any abſurdity in Pliny, when for medicioall
uſes he commended the urine of a Tottoiſe : ſo when we perceivethat

lings with milke; but whereas no other flying animall hath theſe parts, we cannot from them expeR a viviparousexcluſion , bur either ape. neration of egges , or ſome vermiparous ſeparation , whoſe navell is within it ſelfe at firſt, and its nutrition after not inwardly dependent of its originall,
Againe,natute is ſo farre from leaving any one part without its pro- per action, that ſhe oft-times impoſeth two or three labours upon one {o the pizell in animals is both officiall unto urine and to generation, but the firſt and primary uſc is generation z for many creatures enjoy chat part which urine not, as fiſhes, birds, and quadrupeds oviparous z but not onthe contrary, for the ſecondary aRion ſubſiſteth not alone, but in concommitancie with the other ; ſo the noftrills are uſcfull both for reſpiration and ſmelling, but the principall uſe is ſmelling; for many have noftrills which have no lungs, as fiſhes, but none have lungs or reſpiration , which have not ſome ſhew, or ſome analogy of noſtrills: And thus we perceive the providence of nature, that is the wiſdome of God, whichdiſpoſcth of no part in vaine, and ſome parts unto two or three uſes, will not provide any without the execution of its proper of- fice,nor where there is no digeſtion to be made,make any parts inſervi- ent to that intention,
Beſide the teeth, the tongue of this animall is a ſecond argument to overthrow this ayric nutrication, and that not only in its proper nature, bur alſo in its peculiar figure ; for indeed of this part properly taken there are two ends ; that is, the formation of the voice, and the execu- tion of taſte; for the voice, it can have no office in Camelions, for they are mute animals, as, beſide fiſhes, are moſt other ſort of Lizards : As | for their taſte, if their nutriment be ayre,neither can it be an inſtrument thereof ; for the body of thatelement is inguſtible, void of all ſapidi- ty, and without any ation of the rongue,is by the rough artery or wea- zon conducted into the lungs : and therefore Plinie much forgets the ſricneſle of his aſſertion, when he alloweth excrements unto that ani-
mall , that feedeth only upon ayre , whichnotwithſtanding with the urine of an Afſe, hee commends as a magicall medicine upon our enemies.
The figure of the tongue ſeems alſo to overthrow the preſumption of this aliment, which according to theexaR delineation of Aldrovand, is tn this animall peculiar , and ſeemeth contrived for prey ; for in ſo little a creature it is at the leaſt halfe a palme lopg, and being it ſclf ve-
ry flow of motion,hath in this part a very great agility;withall its food | being fAlyes and ſuch as ſuddenly eſcape, it hath inthe tongue a ſpongy and mucous extremity, whereby upona ſudden emiſſion, it jnviſcates

This expoſition is fa voured by {ome, eſpecially theold gloſſe upon Leviticus, whereby in the Tranſlation of Jerome and rhe Septuagint , this animall is forbid- der;what ever it be,it ſeems more reaſonable then that of Thidore, who derives this name, a Camels &- Leone, as preſurning herein ſome reſen- | blance with a Camell , for this derivation offendeth the rules of Ery- mology , wherein indeed the notation of names ſhould be Orthogra- | phicall, not exchanging dipthongs for vowells , or converting conſo-
nants into each other.
As forthe poſſibility hereof,it is not alſo unqueſtionable, and many wiſe men are of opinion,the bodies of animalls cannot receive a pr | aliment from ayre : for beſide that taſte being (25 Ariſtotle rermes ir) [a kinde of rouch, it is required the aliment ſhould betangible, and fall | under the palpable affeRions af touch, beſide alſo that there is ſome | xpor in all alments , as being to be diſtinguiſhed and judged by the euſte, which cannot be admitted in ayre ; Befidetheſe, I (ay, it wee! confider the nature of aliment, and the proper ule of ayre in reſpiration, (twill yery hardly fall under the name hereof , or properly attaine the

And firſt concerning its nature , to make a perfetmurrition into the | body nouriſhed, there is required a tranſmutation of the nutriment;now where this converſion or GE is made, there is alſo required inthe aliment a familiarity of matter,and ſuch a community or vicinity unto a living nature, as by one aR of the ſoule may be converted into | the body of the living, and enjoy one common ſoule 3 which indeed cannot be effected by the ayre,it concurring only with our fleſh in com- mon principles, which are at the largeſt diſtance from life , and cor- mon alſounto inanimated conſtitutions z and therefore when it is ſaid by Fernelius, and afferted by divers others, that we are only nouriſhed | by living bodies , and ſuch as are ſome way proceeding from them, that is the fruits, effeRs, parts, or ſeeds thetcof, they have laid our an | objeR very agreeable unto affimulation z for theſe indeed are fir to re- | | ceive a quick and immediate converſion, as holding ſome commurkey | | with our ſelves, and containing approximate diſpoſicion unto ani- | mation. |

Thirdly (which is the argument of Hippocrates) all aliment received into the body , muſt be therein a confiderable ſpaceretained , and not immediatly expelled : now ayre but momentally remaining in our bodies, it hath no proportionable ſpace for its converſion , that being only of length enough to reftigerate the heart, which having once per. formed, leſt being ic ſelfe heated againe , it ſhould ſuffocate that part, it maketh no ſtay, but haſteth backe the ſame way it paſled in. Fourthly, the proper uſe of ayre attracted by the lungs, and without which there is no durable continuatien in life , is notthe nutrition of parts, but the contemperation of that fervour inthe heart, and the ven. tilation of that fire alwayes maintained in the forge of life; whereby al. though in ſome manner it concurreth unto nutrition , yet can it not re- ccive the proper name of nutriment ; and therefore by Hippocrites de | | alimento, it is tetmed Alimentum now 4limentum, 2 nouriſhment and no | nouriſhment z that is in a large acception, but not in propriety of lan- | guage conſervivg the body,not nouriſhing the ſame,not repairing it by | | affimulation, bur preſerving it by ventilation z for thereby the naturall | flame is preſerved from extinRion , and ſo the individuum ſup- | | ported in ſome way like nutrition : And ſo when it is ſaid by the ſame | Author, Pulms contrarinm corpori alimentum trahit, reliqua emmniaidem, if is notto be taken ina ſtrict and proper ſenſe , but the quality inthe one, the ſubſtance is meant inthe other, for ayre in regard of our naty- rall heat is cold, and in that quality contrary unto it, but what is proper ly aliment, of what quality foever, is potentially the ſaine,and ina ſub- ſtantiall identity unto if. And althoughthe ayreattrated may be conceived to nouriſh that / inviſible lame of life , in as much as common and culinary flames are nouriſhed by the ayre about them ; I confeſle wee doubt the common conceit, which affirmeth that aire is the pabulous ſupply of fire, much lefle that lame is properly aire kindled : And the ſame before us, hath beendenyed by the Lord of Verulam, in his Tra of life and death,& alſo by Dr. Jorden in his book of Minerall waters: For that which ſub- ſtantially maintaineth the fire, is the combuſtible matter in the kind- | led body, and not the ambient ayre, which affordeth cxhalation to its ; fuliginous atomes, nor that which cauſeth the lame properly to be ter- ' med ayre, but rather as he expreſſerhit, the accention of fuliginous ex- | halations, which containe an unQuoſity in them , and ariſe from the / matter of fuell ; which opinion is very probable, and will ſalve many | doubts, whereof the common conceit affordeth no ſolution. As firſt, how fire is ſtrick& out of flints,that is not by kindling the aire | from the collifion of two hard bodies; for then Diamonds and glaſſe | ſhould doe thelike as well as flint, but rather from the ſulphur and in- | amable cfluviums contained in them.

| onely in the ayre about it , and inflameth not the ayre at a diſtance from it © becauſe the flame extendeth not beyond the inflamableefflu- | ence, but cloſly adheres unto the originall of its inflamation,and there- fore it onely warmeth, not kindleth the aire about it , which notwith- ſtanding it will doe, if the ambient aire be impregnate with ſubtile in- | flamabilities, and ſuch as are of quick accenfion,as experiment is made ina cloſe roome, upon an evaparation of ſpirits of wine and Camphir, | | as ſubterraneous fires doe ſometimes happen, and as Creuſa and Alex- anders boy in the bath were ſet on fire by Naptha. Laſtly, the Element of aire is ſo far from nouriſhing the bodie, that ſome have queſtioned the power of water z many conceiving it enters not the body in the power of aliment, or that from thence , there pro-
| cceds a ſubſtantiall ſupply : For beſide that ſome creatures dripke not at all, nmoothers it tis the common office of ayre,and ſerves for refrigeration of the hearr, as unto fiſhes, who receive it,and expell it by | the gills; even unto our ſelves, and more perfeR animals,though many
wayes afſiſtent thereto, ir performes no ſubſtanciall nutricion,in ſerving for refrigeration, dilution of ſolid aliment, and its elixation inthe ſto- macke , which from thence as a vehicle it conveighs through lefle ac- ceſhible cavities into the liver, from thence into the veines, and ſo ina roride ſubſtance throughthe capillaric cavities into every part ; which having performed, it is afterward excluded by urine, ſweat and ſerous ſeparations.

All which conſidered, ſevercr heads will be apt enough to conceive the opinion ofthis animal,not much unlike unto that of the Aſtomi, or men without mouthes in Pliny , ſutable unto the relation of the Mares in Spaine , and their ſubventaneous conceptions , from the weſterne winde; and in ſome way more unreaſonable then the figment of Rabi- can the famous horſe in Arioſto,which being conceived by flame,and wind never taſted grafſſe, or fed onany grofler provender then ayre,for this way of nutrition was anſwerable unto the principles of his genera- tion; which being not ayrie,but groſle and ſeminall inthe Chameleon, anto its conſervation there is required a ſolid paſture, and a food con- generous unto the principles of its nature.

But this cffeR is rather occaſioned upon the greatnes of its lungs, which in this animal are very large, and by their backward ſituation, afford a more obſervable dilatation, and though their lungs bee leſſe , the like inflation is alſo obſervable in Toads.
A ſecond is the continuall hiation or holding open its mouth,which men obſerving conceive the intention therof to receive the aliment of ayre; but this is alſo occaſioned by the greatnes of its lungs, for repleti- on whereof not having a ſufficient or ready ſupply by its noſtrils , it is enforced to dilate and hold open the jawes.
The third is the paucitie of blood obſerved in this animal , ſcarceat all to be found but inthe eye, and about the heart; which defect being obſerved , inclined ſome into thoughts , that the ayre was a ſufficient maintenance for theſe gxauguious parts.” But this defeR or rather
aucity of blood, is alſo agrecable unto many other animals , whoſe bolid nutriment wee doe not controvert , as may bee obſerved in 0- ther ſorts of Lizards, in Fcogges , and divers Fiſh:s, and therefore an Horſe-leech will hardly be made to faſten upon a fiſh,and wee doe not read of much blood that was drawn from Frogges by Mice in that fa- mous battaile of Homer. 4
The laſt and moſt common ground which begat or promoted this opinion , is the long continuation hereof without any viſible food, which ſome precipitouſly obſerving,conclude they cate not any at all. It cannot be denyed it is { if not the moſt of any ) a very abſtemious *
animall.

animall, and ſuch as by reaſonof its frigidity, paucity of blood, and la- ! titancy in the winter, ( about which time the obſervations are often | made) will long ſubſiſt without a viſible ſuſtentation : But a like con- | dition may bce alſo obſerved in many other animals , for Lizards and | Leeches, as we have made triall, will live ſome months without ſuſte- | nance, and wee have included Snailes in glaſſes all winter, which have returned to feed againe in the ſpring: Now theſe notwithſtanding, are not conceived to paſlc all their lives without food , for ſofo argue is fallacious, that is, A minori ad majus, A ditto ſecundum quid ad dittum ſampliciter, and is moreover ſufficiently convicted by experience, and therefore probably other relations are of the ſame verity, which are of the like afhnity, as is the conceitof the Rhintace in Perſia , the Cavis Levisof America, and the Manucodiata or bird of Paradiſe in India. To aſſigne a reaſon of this abſtinence in animals, or declare how without a ſupply there enſueth no deſtruRive exhauſtion , exceedeth the limits of my intention , and intention of my diſcourſe. Fortunius | Licetus in his excellent Trat , De hi qui din viuunt ſine alimentd, hath very ingeniouſly attempted it, deducing the cauſe hereof from an | equall conformity of naturall heat and moiſture, at leaſt no confidera- ble cxuperancy inenher; which concurring in an unactive proportion, | the naturall heat conſumeth not the moiſture (whereby enſueth no ex- hauſtion) and the condition of naturall moiſture is able to refiſt the | ſlender aRion of heat,(whereby it needeth no reparation)and this is e- vident in Snakes, Lizards,Snails,and divers other inſects latirant many moneths in the yeare;which being cold creatures , containing a weak heat, in acrafle or copious humidity doe lovg ſubfiſt without nutri- | - tion: For the activity of the agent, being not able to overmaſter there- ' fiſtance of the patient, there will enſue no deperdition. And uponthe | like grounds it is , that cold and phlegmarick bodies, and ( as Hippo- | crates determineth) that old men , will beſt endure faſting. Now the | ſame harmony and ſtationary conſtitution , as ic happeneth in many | | ſpecies, ſodoth ir fall out fometime in Individualls z.For wee reaiof many who havelived long time without aliment, and beſide deceites and impoſtures,there may be veritable Relations of fame; who'with- out a miracle, and by peculiarity of temper , have far outfaſted Elias.

Cuayr. XXII. Of Unicornes hornes.
Clin account and much profit is made of Unicornes horne, at leaſt of that which bearcth the name thereof; wherein notwithſtanding, many I perceive ſuſpeR an Impoſture, and ſome conceive there isno ſuch animall extant: herein therefore to draw up our determinations, beſide the ſeverall places of Scripture mentioning this animall (which ſome perhaps may contend to be onely meant of the Rhinoceros) wee are {o farre from denying there is any Unicorne at all, that wee affirme there are many kinds thereof, in the number of Quadrupedes, wee will concede no lefle then five; that is, the Indian Oxe, the Indian Aﬀle, the Rhinoceros, the Oryx, and that which is more eminently termed Monoceros, or Y nicornis : Some in theliſt of fiſhes , as that deſcribed by Olaus, Albertus, and many other: and ſome Unicornes wee will allow even among inſeRs , as thoſe foure kinds of naſicornous Beetles deſcribed by Muffetus.
Secondly, although we concede there be many Unicornes, yet are we ſtill to ſeeke,; for whereunto to affixe this horne in queſtion, or to determine from which thereof we receive this magnified medicine,we
| have no aſſurance, or any ſatisfaRory decifion : for although we ſingle

| corne, yet can we not be ſecure what creature is meant thereby , what
conſtant ſhape it holdeth, or in what numberto be reccived : For as | far as our endeavours diſcover , this animall is not uniformely deſcri-
| bed, but differently ſet forth by thoſe that undertake it : Pliny affirmeth | itisa fierce and terrible creature , Fartomannus a tame and manſuete ; animall: thoſe which Garci«s ab Horts deſcribed about the cape of
|
ood hope, were beheld with heads like horſes ; thoſe which Varto- mannus beheld, he deſcribed with the head of a Deere ; Pliny. Zlian Solinus, and after theſe from ocular affurance Panlas Fenetus affirmeth

thoſe two which Vartomannus beheld at Mecha , were as he deſcri- beth footed like a Goate : As &liandeſcribeth, it is inthe bigneſſe of an horſe, as Vartomannus ofa Colt , That which Thevet ſpeaketh of was not ſo big as an Heifer z But Pawlas Fenerws affirtneth, they are but lictle lefle then Elephants 5 which are diſcriminations very materiall, and plainly declare.that under the ſame name Authors deſcribe not the

ſame animall : So that the Unicornes horne of the one, is not that of another, although we proclaime anc<quall yertuc in either.
Thirdly, akhough we were agreed what animall this was, or differ- ed not ig its deſcription, yet would this alſo afford but little ſatisfaRion, for the horne we commonly extoll , is not the ſame with that of the Ancients ; For that in the deſcription of Alian and Pliny was blacke, this which is ſhewed amongſt us is commonly white, none black; and of thoſe five which Scaliger beheld , though one ſpadiceous , or of a light red, and two inclining to red , yet was there not any of this com- plexion among them.
Fourthly, what hornes ſoever they be which paſſe amongſt us, they are not ſurely the hornes of any one kinde of animall, bur muſt proceed from ſeverall ſorts of Unicornes , for ſome are wreathed, ſome not : That famous one which is preſerved at S.Dennis neere Paris, hath aw- fratuous ſpires, and chocleary turnings about it , which agreeth with the deſcription of the Unicornes horne in Alian; Thoſe two in the treaſure of S. Mark are plaine,and beſt accord with thoſe of the Indian Aſe, or the deſcriptions of other Unicornes: Albertxs Magnme delcri- beth one ten foote long , and at the baſe about thirteene inches com- paſſe; And that of Antwerpe which Goroplas Becanwe deſcribeth, is not much inferiour.unto it ; which beſt agree unto the deſcriptions of the Sea-Unicornes, for theſe, as Olaus affirmeth, are of that ſtrength and bigneſle, as able to penetrate the ribs of ſhips; the ſame is moxe probable, in that it was brought from Iſland, from whence, as Becanes affirmeth, three other were brought in his dayes; And we have heard of ſome which have beene found by the ſca fide, and brought unto us from America: So that while we commend the Unicornes horne, and conceive it peculiar but unto one animall , under apprehenſion of the ſame virtue, wee uſe very many , and commend that effeR from all, which every one confineth unto ſome one, hee hath either ſcene or deſcribed.
Fifthly, although there be many Unicornes , and conſequently: many hornes, yet many there are which beare that name, and currant- ly paſſe ainong us, which arc no hornes at all ; and ſuch arethoſe frag- ments, and pieces of Laps Ceratites, commonly termed Corwufofile, whereof Boerixs had no lefle then twenty ſeverall ſorts preſented him for Unicorns horn : hereof in ſubterraneous cavities, & under the earth there are many to be tound in ſeyerall parts of Germany , which are | but the Lapideſcencies, and petrifative mutations of hard bodies, | ſometime of horne, of teeth, of bones, and branches of trees, whereof | there are ſome {o imperfeRly converted, as to retaine the odor and qua- | lities of their originals, as he relateth of pieces of Aſhe and Wallouc. | Apaine, in moſt if not all which paſſe amongſt us, and are extolled for
precious hornes , weediſcover not one affetion common unto other hornes,

hornes, that is, they mollifie not witch fire, chey fotten not upon de-
cretion in either ; which notwithſtanding wee may effeR in Goates hornes, Sheepes, Cows, and Harts horne, in the horne of the Rhino- | ceros, the horne of the Priſtis or Sword-fiſh. Briefly that which is
ved in England, is not onely no horne, but a ſubſtance harder then a bone, that is, the tooth of a Morſe or Seahorſe, in the midſt of the (0. lider part containing a curdled graine, which is not to be found inTyo. ry ; this in Northerne regions is of frequent uſc for hafts of knives, or hilrs of ſwords, and being burnt becomes a good remedy for fluxes; but antidotically uſcd, and expoſed for Unicornes horne, it is an inſuf. ferable deluſion, and with more veniable deceit , ic might have beene | praiſed in Hans horne.
Sixty, although we were ſatisficd we had the Unicornes horne, yet wore it no injury unto reaſon to queſtion the efficacy thereof, or whe- ther thoſe virtues which are pretended do properly belong unto it ; for what we obſerve (and it eſcaped not the obſervation of Pavlus Iovim many years paſt) none of the Ancients aſc:ibed any medicinal or anti. dotall virtue unto the Unicornes horne ; and that which Alian extol- leth, who was the firſt and onely man of the Ancients who ſpake ofthe medicall virtue of any Unicorne, was the hoine ot the Indian Aﬀe,| whereof, ſaith he, the Princes of thoſe parts make boales and drinke| therein, 8s preſervatives againſt poyſon, Convulſions, and the Falling. ficknefſe ; Now the deſcription of that borne is not agreeable unto; that we commend ; for that (ſaith he) is red above, white below, and black in the middle, which is very different from ours, or any to bee ſcene amongſt us ; And thus, though the deſcription of the Unicome be very ancient , yet was there of old no virtue aſcribed unto it, and although this amongſt us receive the opinion of the ſame virtue, yetis it not the ſame horne whereunto the Ancicnts aſcribed it.
Laſtly, although we allow it an Antidotall cfficacy, and ſuch as the | Ancients commended, yet are there ſome viriues aſcribed thereto by Modernes not eaſily to be reccived ; and it hath ſurely falne out inthis as other magnified medicines, whoſe operations effetuall in ſome diſcaſes, are preſently extended unto all : That ſome antidotall quality it may have wee have no reaſontodeny ; for fince Elkes hootes and hornes are magnified for Epilepſics , fince noc onely the bone inthe heart, but the horne of a Deere is Alexipharmacall, and ingredient in- tothe confeRion of Hyacinth, and the EleQuary of Maximilian, wee cannot without prejudice except againſt the fhcacy of this : But when we affirme it is not onely Antidorall to proper venomes,and ſubſtances
| |
deſtruRive by qualities, we cannot «cxprefle ; but that it 1efiſterh alſo Sublimate, Arſenick, and poyſons which kill by ſecond qualities, that

is, by corroſionof parts, doubt we exceed the properties of its nature, and the promiſes of experiment will not ſecure the adventure: And therefore in ſuch extremities, whether there be not more probable re- life from fat and oylic ſubſtances, which are the open tyrants of ſalt and corrofive bodics,then precious and cordiall medicines which ope- rate by ſecret and diſputable proprictics z or whether he that ſwallow- ed Lime, and dranke downe Mercury water, did not more reaſonably | place his cure in milke, bitter, or oyle, then if he had recurred unto Pearle and Bezoar, common reaſon at all times, and neceſlity inthe | like caſe would eafily determine. =
Since therefore there be many Unicornes , fince that whereto wee appropriate a horne is ſo variouily deſcribed, that it ſcemeth either { never to have beene ſcene by two perſons , or not to have beene one animall Since though they agreed in the deſcription of the animall, yet is not the horne wee extoll the ſame with that of the Ancients; Since what hornes ſoever they be that paſſe among tis, they are not the hornes of one but ſeverall animals : Since many in common uſe and high eſtceme are no hornes at all: Since if they were true hornes, yet | might their vertues be queſtioned: Since though weallowed ſome vir. | tues, yet were not others to be received, with what ſecurity a man may | rely on this remedy , the miſtreſſe of fooles hath already inſtructed ſome, and to wiſdome (which is never too wile to learne). it is not too | late to confider.

Book Jo | and are knowne by common names with thoſe at land , as their deſcri- bers atteſt, they receive Bot theſe appellations, as we conceive, from a totall fimilitude in figure, but any concurrence in common accidents, in colour, condition, or ſingle conformation : as for Sex-horſes which much confirme this afſertion, in their common deſcriptions, they are but Croteſco deliniations which fill up empty ſpaces in Maps , and meere picoriall inventions, not any Phyſical ſhapes : ſutable unto | thoſe which (as Plinie delivereth) Praxiteles long agoe ſet out in the Temple of Domitius : for that which is commonly called a Sea-horſe is properly called a Morſe, and makes not out that ſhape : That which the Ancients named Hippecampus is alittle animall about fix inches long , and not preferred the claſfis of InſeRs : that they tear- med Hippopotamus an amphibious animall , about the River Nile, ſo | little refernbleth an horſe,chatas Mathiolus obſerveth io all,cxcept the | feet, it better makes out a ſwine: that which they tearmed a Lion, was but a kinde of Lobſter : and that they called the Beare , was but one | ktinde of Crab, and that which they named Bos marinus, was not as we conceive a fiſh reſembling an Oxe, but a Skaite or Thornbacke, ſo na- | | med from its bigneſſe, expreſſed by the Greek word Bow, which is a prefixe of augmentation to many words in that language.
And therefore although it be not denied that ſome inthe water doe carry a juſtifiable reſemblance to ſome at the Land , yet are the major part which beare their names unlike; nor doe they otherwiſe reſemble | the creatures on earth , thenthey on earth the conſtellations which
paſſe under animall names in heaven : nor the Dog-fiſh at ſea much j more make out the Dog of the land , then that his cognominall or name-ſake inthe heavens. - Now if from a fimilitude inſome , it bee reaſonable to infer a correſpondency in all,we may draw this analogie of animalls upon plants ; for vegetables there are which carry a neare and allowable fimilicude unto animals, as we elſewhere declare : wee might alſo preſume to conclude that animall ſhapes were generally made out in mineralls : for ſeverall ſtones there are that beare their names inrelation to animals parts, as Lapis avguinus, Conchites,Echi- nites, Eucephalites, Agopthalmus, and many more, as will appeare in

Now the reaſon of this ſtrange and peculiar noiſe, is well deduced from the conformation of the windepipe, which in this birde is diffe- rent from other volatiles.

Which diviſion conſiſteth onely of Semicircular fibers,and ſuch as attaine but half way round the part; By which formation they are dilatable into larger capacities , and are able to containe a fuller proportion of ayre, which being with violence ſent up the weazon,and finding no refiſtance by the Larinx, it iſſueth forth in 2 ſound like that from cavernes,and ſuch as ſometimes ſubterraneous eruptions, from hollow rocks afford z As Ariftotle obſerverh in a Pro- blem of the 25.

And this is agreeable unto the determina- tion of Ariſtotle : who computeth the time of their anopſic or inviſion by that of their geſtation, for ſome ſaith he do B90 with their yong, the ſixt part ofa yeer,a day or two over or under, that is, about fixry dayes | or nine weekes, and the whelps of theſe ſee not till twelve —_— ſome 2oe the fifth part of a yeer, that is, 71. dayes, and theſe faith he ſce not | before the fourteenth day.

And to ſpeak ftriQly it is no cafie matter to determine the point of death in inſects and creatures who have not their vitalities radically confined unto one part;for theſc are not dead when they ceaſe to moye or afford the viſible evidencies of life; as may be manifeſtly obſerved inflyes, who whenthey appear even deſperate and quite forſaken of their formes, by vertue of the ſun or warme aſhes will be revoked unto life, and performe its funQtions againe. 13- The wiſdomot the Piſmire is magnified by all,and inthe Pane- gyricks of their providence we alwayes mect with this, that to prevent the growth of corne which they ſtore up they bire off the end thereof: And ſome have conceived that from hence they have their name in | Hebrew : From whence ariſeth a conceit that corne will not grow if the extreams be cut or broken.

earth, it muſt not be ſtriQly taken , for though in Serpents and Lizards we may truly allow a proneneſſe, yet Galen acknowledgeth that per- fe Quadrupedes, as Horſes, Oxen, and Camels, are but partly prone, and have ſome part of ereneſle; and birds or flying animals , are fo farre from this kinde of proneneſle, that they are almoſt ere, advan- cing the head and breaſt in their progreſſion,and onely prone in the a of their volitation; and ifthat be true which is delivered of the Penguin or Anſer Magellanicus , and often deſcribed in Maps about thoſe Straits , that they goc ereRQlike men, and with their breaſt and belly do make one line perpendicular unto the axis of the carth; it will make up the exaR erectnefle of man; nor will that inſet come very ſhort which we have often beheld, that is, one kinde of Locuſt which ſtands not prone, or a little inclining upward, but ina large ercneſle, eleya- ting alwayes the two fore legs, and ſuſteining it ſelfe inthe middle of the other foure ; by Zoographers called manid , and by the Common people of Province, Pr/ga Dio, that is, the Prophet and praying Lo- cuſt, as being generally tound inthe poſture of ſupplication, or ſuch as reſembleth ours, when we lift up our hands to heaven.
As for the end of this ere@ion, to looke up toward heaven, though confirmed by ſeverall teſtimonies, and the Greek Etymology of man, it is not ſo readily to be admitted ; and as a popular and vaine conceit was anciently rejeed by Galen; who in his third, De »ſ# pertiuw,de- termines, that man is ere becauſe he was made with hands, and was therewith to exerciſe all Arts which in any other figure he could not have performed,as he excellently declareth in that place where he alſo proves that man could have beene made neither Quadruped , nor Centaur. The ground and occaſion of this conceit was a literall apprehenſion of a figurative expreſſion in Plato, as Galen plainely delivers, the cffeRt of whoſe words is this: To opinion that man is cre to looke up and behold the heavens, is a conceit onely fit for thoſe that never {aw the fiſh Uranoſcopus, that is, the Beholder of heaven ; which hath its eyes ſo placed, that it lookes up direRly to heaven, which man doth not, except he recline, or bend his head backward ; and thus to looke upto heaven agrecth not onely unto men, but Aſeszto omit birds with long

Now alchough Galen in this place makes inſtance but in one, yet are there other fiſhes, whoſe eyes regard the heavens, as Plane, and cartilagineous fiſhes as peRinals, or ſuch as have the Apophyles of their ſpine made laterally like a combe, for when they apply them- (clves to ſleepe or reſt upon the white ſide, their eyes on the other ſide looke upward toward heaven: for birds, they generally carry their : heads ereQly like man, and ſome have adyantage in that they moye not | their upper cyclid;and many that have long necks, and bear their heads | ſomewhat backward, behold farre more of the heavens , and ſeemeto | look abovethe zxquinoxiall circle;zand fo alſo in many Quadrupeds.al- | —_ their progreſſion be partly prone , yet is the fight of theireye | direR, not reſpeRing the carth but heaven , and makes an higher arch of alticude then our owne. The poſition of a Frogge with his head above water exceedcth theſc; for therein hee ſcemes to behold a large | part of the heavens, and the acies of his eycto aſcend as highas the | Tropick; but he that hath beheld the poſture of a Bitour, will not deny that it beholds almoſt the very Zenith,

The other ground is more particular and upon inſpeRion z for in dead bodies eſpecially lying upon the ſpine, the heart doth ſcem to in- clineuoto the left , which happeneth not from its proper fie , but be- fides its ſiniſtrous gravity is drawne that way by the great arterie, which then ſubſideth & haleth the heart unto it, And therefore ſtriQ- ly taken,the heart is ſeated in the middle of the cheſt; but after a care- leſſe and inconfiderate aſpeRion, or according to the readieſt ſenſe of pulſation, wee ſhall not quarrell if any afficme it is ſeated toward the left; and in theſe conſiderations muſt Ariſtotle be ſalyed, when hee af. firmeth the heart of man is placed in the left {ide,and thus in a po acception may wee receive the periphraſis of Perſius when hee taketh che part under the left pappe for the heart; and if rightly apprehended, irconcerneth not this controverſie, when it is ſaid io Eccleftaſtes, The heart of a wiſeman is in the right ſide, bur that of a fool in the lefe. | Thataſſertionalſothat man proportionally hath the largeſt brain , did I confeſſe ſomewhat doubt, and conceived it might have failed in birds, eſpecially ſuch as having little bodies , have yet large cranies, and ſeemeto containe much brain,as Snipes, Woodcoks,8&c. but upon triall I finde it very true.

Cu 4% LY. | Of the Ring fenger,
AS opinion there is, which magnifies the condition of the fourth finger of the left hand, preſuming therein a cordiall relation, that a particular veſſel], nerve, veine, or arteric is conferred thereto from the | heart, and therefore that eſpecially hath the honour to beare our rings; | which was not only the Chriſtian praRtiſe in Nuptiall contracts, but obſerved by the heathens, as Alexander 4b Alexandro,Gellius. Macro- bius, and Pierius haue delivered, as lately Levinus Lemnius hath con- firmed, who affirmes this peculiar veſſell to bee an Arterie , and not a nerve,as antiquitie conceived it; adding moreover that rings hereon pe- culiarly affeR the heart;that in Lipothymies or ſwoundings he uſed the frication of this finger with ſaffron and gold ; that the ancient Phyfiti- ans mixed up their Medicines herewith z that this is ſeldome or laſt of | all affected with the Gout , and when that becommeth nodous, men continue not long after : notwithſtanding all which we remaine unſa- tisfied, nor can we thinke the reaſons alledged ſufficiently eſtabliſhthe priviledge of this finger.
For firſt , concerning thepraRice of antiquity the cuſtome was not generall to weare their rings either on this hand or finger; for it is ſaid,
and that emphatically in Jeremiah , $2 fuerit Jeconias filius Ivachimre 2is Inde annulus in many dextri mea, inde evellam eum : Though Co- |

hand, yet would Ipluck thee thence : So is itoblerved by Pliny that in the portraits of their Gods the rings were worneon the finger next the thumb, that the Romans wore them alſo upon their little finger, as Neto is deſcribed in Petronius : ſome wore them on the middle fin- ger asthe ancient Gaules and Britans, and ſome uponthe forefinger, as is deduccable from Julius Pollux, who names that ring Corionos.
Againe , that the praQice of the Ancients had any ſuch reſpeR of |
cordialicy or reference unto the heart will much be doubted if we con- ſider thcir rings were made of Iron; ſuch was that of Prometheus who is coriceived the firſt that brought them in uſe , ſo, as Pliny afficmeth, for many yeares the Senators of Rome did not weare any rings of Gold : but the ſlaves wore generally Iron rings untill their manumiſh on or preferment to ſome dignity; That the Lacedemonians continued their Iron rings unto his dayes, Pliny alſodelivereth ; and ſurely th
uſed few of Gold , for befidethat Lycurgus prohibited that mertall,
we read in Athenzus that having a deſire toguild the face of Apollo,
they enquired of the oracle where they might purchaſe ſo much gold, and were direRed unto Crzſus King of Lydia.
Moreover whether the Ancients had any ſuch intention,the grounds |
which they conceived in veyne, nerve, or artery, are tot to be juſtificd, nor will infpeion confirm a peculiar veſfell in this finger : for as Ana-
tomy informeth, the Baſilica veyne dividing into two branches below |
the cubit , the outward ſendeth two ſurcles unto the thumb, two unto the forcfinger, and one unto the middlefinger in the inward fide ; the other branch of the Baſilica ſendeth one ſurcle unto the outſide of the middlefinger,two unto the Ring, and as many unto the littlefingers; ſo that they all proceed from the Bafilica , and are inequall numbers de- rived unto every one : In the ſame manner arethe branches of the axil- lary artery diftributed into the hand, for below the cubit it divideth in- to two parts,the one running along the Radius,and paſſing by the wreſt or place of the pulſe , is at the fingers ſubdivided into three branches,
whereof the firſt conveyeth two ſurcles unto the thumb, the ſecond as |
many tothe forefinger , and the third one unto the middlefinger ;. the other or lower diviſion of the artery deſcendeth by the ulna, and fur- niſheth the other fingers, that is the middle with one ſurcle, and the ring and little fingers with two; as for the neryes they are diſpoſed much after the ſame maner,and have their originall from the braio,and not the heart, as many of the Ancients conceived; which is fo farre from affording nerves unto other parts, that it receiveth very few it ſelf from the ſixt conjugation, or paire of nerves in the brain.
Laſtly , theſe propagations being communicated unto both hands, we have no greater reaſon to weare our rings onthe left , then onthe right, nor are there cordiall conſiderations inthe one, more then the 0- ther z and therefore when Foreſtus for the ſtanching of blood makes

uſe of Topicall applications untothe fourth finger, he confines not that ratice unto _ = , but — _— to the noftrill leeding : and ſo in fevers, where t primarily ſuffereth, we pl medicine unto the wreſts of either armezand {o we touch the 4 of both , and judge of the affeRions of the heart by the one as well as the other : and although in indiſpoſitions of liver or ſpleene conki- derations are made in Phlebotomy reſpeRively to their fituation; yet when the heart is affeted men have thought it as cffeRuall to bleed on the right as the left ; and although alſo it may be thought; a nearer re- ſpe is to be had of the left, becauſe the great artery proceeds from the left ventricle, and ſo is nearer that arme, it admits notthat confiderati- on; for under the channell bones the artery divideth into two great branches, from which trunke or point of diviſion the diſtance unto ei- ther hand is equall, and the confideration anſwerable.
And therefore Macrobius diſcuſſing the point, hath alleadged ano- ther reaſon , affirming that the geſtation of rings upon this hand and fioger , might rather be uſed for their conveniency and preſervation then any cordiall relation z for at firſt (ſaith he) it was both free and uſuall to weare rings on either hand , bur after chat when pretious gems and rich inſculptures were added, the cuſtome of wearing them on the right hand was tranſlated unto the left, for that hand being lefſe employed, thereby they were beſt preſerved; and for the ſame reaſon they placed them on this finger, for the thumb was too aQive a finger, and is commonly imployed with either of thereſt : the
Index or forefinger was too naked whereto to commit their pretioſitics
| ſo good Embalmers we have already ſhewed; and though this reaſon
and hath the tuition of the thumbe ſcarce unto the ſecond joynt : the middle and little finger they rejeRed as extreams, and too big or too little for their riggs,and of all choſeout the fourth as being leaſt uſed of any, as being guarded on either fide, and having in moſt this peculiar condition that it cannot be extended alone and by it ſelfe, but will bee accompained by ſome finger on either ſide : and to this opinionafſen- teth Alexander 4b Alexandro, 4nnulum naptialem prior a1 in ſiniftr ferebat, crediderins ne attereretur.
Now that which begat or promoted the common opinion, was the |: common conceit that the heart was ſeated onthe left fide, but how far this is verified, we have before declared. The _— praQice hath much advanced the ſame , who unto this finger a nerve from the heart, and therefore the Prieſt anointed the ſame with pretiousoyls | before the altar ; but how weake Anatomiſts they were, which were
tooke moſt place , yet had they another which more commended that pracice , and that was the number whereof this finger was an Hiero-
glyphick : for by holding downe the fourth finger of the left hand. | leh rſt mer emenes rey gnfies he pete mules 2 num

As for the obſervationof Lemnius an eminent Phyſttian,concerning the gowt, how ever it happened in his country , wee may obſerve it otherwiſe in ours ; that is, that chiragricall perſons doe ſuffer in this finger as well as inthe reſt, and ſometimes firſt of all , and ſometimes no where elſe ; and for the mixing up medicines herewith, it is rather an argument of opinionthen any conſiderable effeR, and we as highly conceive of the praQice in Diapalma, that is in the making of that plai- ſer, to ſtirre it with the ſtick of a Palme.

For firſt the right and lefc, are nor defined by Philoſophers accord- ing to common acception, that is, reſpeRively from one manunto an- other, or any conſtant fite in each; as though that ſhould bee the right | in one, which upon confront or facing ſtands a thwart or diagonially unto the other, but were diſtinguiſhed according to the aRivitic and | predominant locomotion: upon either fide : Thus Ariſtole in his ex. cellent Trac de Inceſſu animalium a(cribeth fix poſitions unto animals, anſwering the three dimenſions; which he determineth not by ſite or pofition unto the heavens , but by their faculties and funRions , and theſe are Imum ſummuam, Ame Retro, Dextra Siniſtrs : that is , the (uperiour part where the aliment is received , that the lower extreme | where it is laſt expelled; ſohee termeth a man a plant inverted, for hee {uppoſcth the root of a tree the head or upper part thereof, whereby it receiveth its aliment, although therewith it reſpes the Center of the carth , but with the other the Zenith z and this poſation is anſwerable unto longitude : Thoſe parts are anterior and meaſure profunditie wherethe ſenſes , eſpecially the eyes are placed , and thoſe poſterior which are oppoſite hereunto; The dextrous and finiſtrous parts of the body make up the Latitude, and are not certain and inalterable like the other; for that ſaith hee , is the right fide from whence the motion of the body beginneth, that is, the aRive or moving fide, but that the fi niſter which is the weaker or more quieſcent part : of the ſame deter- mination were the Platonicks and Pythagorians before him, who con- ceiving the heavens an animated body , named the Eaſt the right or dextrous part, from whence began their motion: and thus the Greeks | from wence the Latines have borrowed their appellation, have named this hand 4*5* denominating it not from the ſire, but office from xe capio,that is,the hand w** receiveth,or is uſually implied in that aRion.
Now upon theſe grounds we are moſt commonly miſtaken , defi- ning that by ſituation which they determined by motion, and givethe terme of right hand to that which doth not properly admit it: For firſt, many intheir infancy are finiſtrouſly diſpoſed, and divers continue all theirlite Ae7e;; that is left handed , and have but weak and imperteR uſe of the right z now unto theſe that hand is properly the right, and not the other eſtemed ſo by fituation: Thus may Ariſtotle bee made out , when hee affirmeth the right claw of Crabbes and |Lobſters is biggeſt,if we take the right for the moſt vigorous fide,and not regard the relative ſituation; for the one is yy bigger then the other , yet not alwayes upon the ſame fide : fo may it bee verified what is delivered by Scaliger in his Comment, that Palfies do oftneſt happen upon the left ſide it underſtood in this ſenſe;the moſt vigorous part proteRiog it ſelfe, and protruding the matter upon the —

lefle reſiſtive fide : and thus the Law of Common-Weales,that cut off theright hand of MalctaQors, it Philoſophically executed, is impar- ciall, otherwiſe the amputation not equally puniſhethall.
Some are Aug tws, that is, ambidexterous ot right-handed on both fides,which happeneth only unto ſtrong and Achleticall bodies,whoſe heat and ſpitits are able to afford an abiliry unto bottry and therefore Hippocrates ſaith, that women are not ambidexterous,that is, not ſo of- ren a5 men, for ſome are found, which indifferently make uſe of both, and ſo may Ariſtotle ſay, that only man is Ambidexter, of this conſti- cution was Aſteropzus in Homer, and Parthenopeus the Theban Cap- raine in Statius z and of the ſame doe ſome conceive our Father Adam to have been,as being perteRly framed,and in a conſtinition admitting leaſt defeR: Now in theſe men the right hand is on both fides, and that which is the oppoſite to the one, is not the left unto the other.
Againe, ſome are Auzae:;xe92 3S Galen hath expreſſed: that is, Am- bilevous or left handed on both fides; ſuch as with agility and vigour have not the uſc of either , who are not gymnaſtically compoſed ; nor actively uſe thoſe parts; now in theſe there is no right hand : of this conſtitution are many women, and ſome. men z whothough they ac- cuſtome themſelves unto either hand, dodexterouſly make uſe of nei- ther, and thereforcalthough the Politicall adviſe of Ariſtotle bee very good, that men ſhould accuſtom themſelves tro the command of either hand, yet cannot the execution Or performance thereof be generall, for | though there bee many found that can uſe both , yetwill there di- vers remaine that can ſtrenuouſly make uſe of neither.
Laſtly, theſe lateralities in man are not onely fallible , if relatively | determined unto each others, but made in reference unto the heavens, and quarters of the Globe: for thoſe parts are not capable of theſe con- | ditions in themſelves,nor with any certainty reſpeRively derived from us, nor we from them againe. And firſt in regard of their proper na- ture, the heavens admit not theſe ſiniſter and dexter reſpeRts, there be- ing in them no diverfitie or difference , but a fimplicity of parts , and equiformity in motion continually ſucceeding each other; ſo that from what point ſoever we compute, the account will be common unto the whole circularity, and therefore though it be plauſible, it is not funda- mentall what is delivered by Solinus, That man was therefore a Mi- crocoſme or little world, becauſe the dimenſions of his poſitions were anſwerable unto the greater ; for as in the heavens the diſtance of the North and Southerne pole, which are eſteemed the ſuperiour and infe- | riour poynts, is equall unto the ſpace between the Eaſt and Weſt , ac- counted the dextrous and finiſtrons parts thereof ; ſo is it alſo in man: for the extent of his fathome, or diſtance betwixt the extremity of the | fingers of either hand uponexpanſion, is equall untothe ſpace berween

Book, 4. terre a dextrality inthe heavens, and we may as reaſonably conchude a right and left laterallity inthe Ark or navall edifice of Noah : for the length thereof was thirty cubits , the bredth fifty , and the heigth or profundity thirty , which well agreeth unto the proportion of man, whoſc length that is a perpendicular from the vertix unto the ſoalofthe foot is ſextuple unto his breadth , or a right line drawne from theribs of one fide to another; and decuple unto his profundiry that is a dire line berweenthe breaſt bone and the ſpine.
Againe, they reccive not theſe conditions with any aſſurance or ſta- bility from our ſelves; for therelative foundations and points of deno- mination, are not fixed and certaine, but variouſly defigned according co imagination, The Philoſopher accounts that Eaſt from whence the ding the South and Mcridian Sun, calls that the dextrous part of heaven which reſpeReth his right hand, and that is the Weſt. Poets reſpeRing the Welt aſſign the name of right unto the North which regardeth their right hand, and ſo muſt that of Ovid be explaned , «tg, due dexira zone iotidemy, finifirs : But Augurs or Southſayers turning their face tothe Eaſt, did make the right in the South, which was alſo obſerved by the Hebrews
Enquiries into Vulgar
and Chaldzans. Now it we name the quarters of heaven reſpeRively
unto our fides, it will be no certaine or invariable denomination; for if wecall that the right ſide of heaven which is ſcated Exſterly unto os, when we regard the meridian Sun, the inhabitants beyond the equator
|
and Southerne Tropick when they face ns regarding the meridian | will contrarily define it z for unto them, the oppoſite part of heaven will reſpe the left, and the Sun ariſe totheir right,
And thus have we at large declared that although the right be moſt commonly uſed,yet hath it no regular or certaine root in nature : Since it is moſt confirmable from other animalls : Since in children it ſcemes either indifferent or more favourable inthe other, but more reaſonable for uniformity in aRion that men accuſtome unto one : Since the grounds and reaſons urged for it doe no way ſupport it : Since it there be a right and ſtronger fide in nature, yet may we miſtake in its deno- mination, calling that the right which is che left, and the left which is the 1ight : Since ſome have one right, ſome both, ſome neither : and laſtly, Since theſc affeRions in manare nor only fallible in relation unto one another, but made alſo in reference unto the heavens, they being not capable of theſe conditions in themſclves , nor with any certainty from us, nor we from them againe. | And therefore what admiſhon we owe unto many conceptions con- cerning right and left requireth circumſpeRion; that is, how far wee ought torelye uponthe remedy of Kiramides , that is the left eyc of an Hedgehog fryed inoyle to procure fleep , and the right foot of a frog ina Deers skin for the gowtz or that to dream of the lofle of right

Secondly, rhat perſons drowned ariſe and float the ninth day when
their gall breaketh , is a queſtionable determination both 1n the time and cauſe, for the time of floating it is uncertain according to the time of putrefaRion, which will retard or accelerate according t6 the ſubjeR and ſeaſon of the year, for as we have obſerved cats and mice will arife uriequally and at different times, though drowned at the ſame; ſuch 4 are fatted doe commonly float , for their bodies ſooneſt fer- ment, and that ſubſtance neareſt unto ayre : andthis is  ohie of Ariſtotles reaſons why dead Eeles will not float , becauſe faith he, they have but ſlender bellies, and little fat.
As for the cauſe it is not ſo reaſonably imputed unto the breaking of the gall as the putrefaRionof the body , whereby the unnaturall heat prevailing the putrifying parts do ſuffer a turgeſcence and inflation, and becomming airy and ſpumous affeR to approach the ayre, andaſcend unto the ſurface of the matter : and this is alſo evidenced in egges wherot the ſound ones ſink, 8: ſuch as arc addled ſwim,as do alſothoſe which are tearmed hypenemia or wind-epges, and this is alſo a way to ſeparate ſeeds, whereof ſuch as are corrupted and ſterill ſwims and this agreeth not only unto the ſeed of plants lockt up and capſulated in

That the breaking of the gall is not the cauſe hereof experience hath | opening the abdomen , and taking out the gall in , cats and mice, they did notwithſtanding ariſe : and becauſe wee had | readin Rhodiginvs of a Tyrant, whoto prevent the emergencie of murdered did uſe to cut off their lungs, and found mens minds poſieſſed with this reaſon, we committed ſome unto the water wichout lungs , which ine floated with the others : and to com- nn npyeee

| point it ſelfe is dubious z and were it true therealon alleadged for it, is of no validity. The reaſon yet currant was firſt expreſſed by Pliny, veluti pudori defunitarum parcente natera , nature modeſtly ordaining chis poſition to conceale the ſhame of the dead, which hath been taken up by Solinus, Rhodigious, and many mage: This indeed (as Scaliger rearmcth it) is ratio civils non philoſofſhica, ſtrong enough tor morality or Rhetoricks, not for Philoſophy or Phyficks : for firſt, innaturethe concealment of ſecret parts is the ſame in both ſexes and the ſhame of their reveale equall : ſo Adam upon the taſte of the fruit was aſhuned of his nakednefle as well as Eve: and ſo likewiſe in America and coun- tries unacquainted with habits, where modeſty concealestheſe parts in one ſex, it doth it alſo inthe other ; and therefore had this been the intention of nature , not only women , but men alſo had ſwimmed
downwards, the poſture inreaſon being common unto both where |
the intent is alſo common.
Againe, while herein we commend the modeſty, we condemne the wiſdome of nature : for that prane poſition we make her contrive un- tothe woman , were beſt agreeable unto the manin whom the ſecret parts are very anterior and more diſcoverable in a ſupine and upward poſture : and therefore Scaliger declining this reaſon hath recurred un- co another from the difference of parts in both ſexes, fo ſunt mulieres plenog, imeſtinks , itag, minus impletur & ſubſidet, ins- nior maribus quibus nates preponderant : If ſo, then men with great bellies will float downward , and only Callipygz and women largely compoled behinde, upward. But Anatomiſts obſerve that to make [the larger cavity forthe Infant, the hanch bones in women, and con-
ſequently the parts appendant are more protuberant then they are in |
men: They who aſcribe the cauſe unto the breaſts of women, take not away the doubt , for they reſolve not why children float downward who arc included inthat ſex, though not inthe reaſon alleadged : but hereof we ceaſe to diſcourſe leſt we undertake to afford a reaſon of the * polden tooth, that is to invent or aſſignea cauſc , when we remaine unſatisfied or unaſſured of the effeR.,

and ſtrangling a chicken in the Scales, upon an immediate ponderati- on, we could diſcover no ſenfible difference in weight, but ſuffering it tolye eight or ten howres , untill it grew perfeRly cold , it weighed moſt ſenſibly lighter z the like we attempted, and verified in mice, and performed their trials in Scales that would turne upon the eighth or tenth part of a graine, E
Now whereas ſome alledge that ſpirits are light ſubſtances, and na- turally aſcending doelevate and watt the body upward, whereof dead bodies being deſtitute contraQ a greater gravity; although we concede chat ſpirits are light, comparatively unto the body, yet that they are ab- ſolutely ſo, or have no weight at all , wee cannot readily allow for ſince Philoſophy affirmeth that ſpirits are middle ſubſtances be- eweenethe ſoule and body, they muſt admit of ſome corporiety which ſuppoſeth weight or gravity. Beſide, in carcaſſes warme, and bodies newly diſanimated while tranſpiration remaineth, there doeexhale and breathe out vaporous and fluid parts, which carry away ſome power of gravication 3 which though we muſt allow, we do not make anſwera- ble unto livitg expiration, and therefore the Chicken or Mice were not ſo light being dead , as they would have beene after ten houres kept alive, for in chat ſpace a man abateth many ounces z nor if it had lept, for in thar ſpace of ſleepe, a man will ſometimes abate forty oun- ces, nor if it had beene inthe middle of ſummer, for then a man weigh- eth ſome pounds leſſe then in the heighth of winter , according to cx- perience, and the ſtatick aphoriſmes of SanRorius. Apaine, whereas men affirme they perceave an addition of ponde- rofity in dead bodies, comparing them uſually unto blocks and ſtones, whenſoever they lift or carry them, this acceſſionall preponderancy is rather in appearance then reality z tor being deſtitute of any motion, they conferre noreliefe unto the Agents or Elevators , which makes us meet with the fame complaints of gravity in animated and living bodies, where the nerves ſubſide, and the faculty locomotive ſcemes aboliſhed, as may be obſerved inthe lifting or ſupporting of peiſons incbriated, ApopleRicall, or in Lipothymics and ſwoundings. Many arc alſoof opinion, and ſome learned men maintaine , that men arc lighter after meales then before, and that by a ſupply and ad- dition of ſpirits obſcuring the groſle ponderofity of the aliment inge- ſted ; but the contrary hereof we have found in the triall of ſundry per- ſonsin different ſex, and ages 3 and we conceave men may miſtake if they diſtinguiſh not the ſenſe of levity uttothemſclves, and in regard of the ſcale or decifion of trutination, for after a draught of winc a man may ſeeme lighter in himſelfe from ſudden reteRion, athough he be heavier in the balance, from a corporall and ponderous addition ; but a man in the morning is lighter in the ſcale, becauſe in ſleepe ſome pounds have perſpired, and is alſo lighter unto himſclfe, becauſe he is

CHap. X. Of the Irwer.
I rr Jews ſtinck naturally, thatis, that intheir race and nation there is tows gf evil ſavour,is 2 received opiniongwee know not how to admit z although we concede many queſſionble points, and diſpute not the verity of ſundry opinions which are of affinity hereto : we will acknowledge that certaine odours attend on animalls,no lefſe then cer- taine colours; that pleaſant ſmels arenot confined unto vegetables, but found in divers animalls, and ſome more richly then in plants: and though the Probleme of Ariſtotle enquire why none ſmells ſweet be- fide the parde? yet later diſcoveries adde divers ſorts of Monkeys, the Ciyet cat, and Gazela,from which our muske proceedeth : we confeſſe that beſide the ſmell of the ſpecies, there may be Individuall odours,
and every man may have a proper and peculiar ſavourwhich alt not perceptible unto man, who hath this ſenſe, but weake, yet ſenſible unto dogpes, who hereby can ſingle out their Maſters inthe dark : wee will not deny that particular men have ſent forth a pleaſant ſavour , as Theophraſtus and Plutark _ of Alexander the great, and Tzetzes and Cardan doe teſtifie of themſelyes ; That ſome 'may alſo emiten unſavoury odour,we have no reaſon to deny, for this may happen froth the qualitie of what they have taken, the Fztor wheel may diſcover it ſelt by ſweat and urine, as being unmaſterable by the naturall heat of man, nor to be dulcified by concoRion beyond an unſayoury conditi- on: the like may come to paſſe from putrid humors,as is often diſcove- rable in putrid & malignant fevers ; and ſomtime alſo ingroffe and hu- i _ even = the nocd of _— _— - the wy iog inſufficient for a through digeſtio the errors 0 one concoRion not reQifiable by another: but tharen unſavoury odour is gentilicious or national unto the Jews,if rightly underſtood;we can- not well concede,nor will the information of reaſon or ſenſe induce it. For firſt upon conſult of reaſon, there will bee found no cafic afſi- | rance for to faſten a materiall or temperamental! propriety upon any nation ; there being ſcarce any condition ( but what depends upon clime) which is not exhauſted or obſcured from the commixture of in- trovenient nations either by commerce or conqueſt;much more will it be difficult to make out this affeRion inthe Jewes , whoſe race how ever pretended to bepure , muſt needs have ſuffered inſeparable com- mixtures with nations of all ſorts, not onely in regard of their profe- lytes, but their univerſall diſperſion ; ſome being parts of the earth, others quite loſt , and ſwallowed up in thoſe nations

The tribes that returned to India, were afterward widely diſperſed, for beſide fixteene thouſand which Titus ſent to Rome unto the tri- umph of his father Veſpaſian , hee ſold no lefle then an hundred thou-
ſand for {laves; not many yeeres after Adrian the Emperour, who rui- | ned the whole Countrey , tranſplanted many thouſands into Spaine, from whence they diſperſed into divers Countreys, as into France,and England, but were baniſhed after from both : from Spaine they diſper- ſed into Africa,Italy, Conſtantinople, and the dominions of the Turke, where they remaine as yet in very great numbers, and if (according to good relations) where they may freely ſpeake it , they forbeare not to boaſt that there are at preſcnt many thouſand Jewes in Spaine, France, and England,and ſome diſpenſed withall, even to the degree of Prieſt- hood, it is a matter very conſiderable, and could they be ſmelled out, would much advantage,not onely the Church of Chriſt, bur alſo the coffers of Princes. | | Now having thus lived in ſeverall Countreyes, and alwayes in ſub- { jeRion, they muſt needs have ſuffered many commixtures,and wee are ſure they are not exempted from the common contagion of Venerie contracted firſt from Chriſtians z nor are fornications unfrequent be- tweenthem both, there commonly paſling opinions of invitement, that their women defire copulation with them , rather then their owne nation,and affet Chriſtian carnality above circumciſed venery.

Y | As fortheir generations and conceptions,(which are the purer from good dyct) they become more pure and perfeR by the {tri obſerva- | tion of their Law; upon the injunRions whereof ,they ſeverely obſerve the times of Purification, and avoid all copulation , either in the un- cleanneſſe of themſelves, or impurity of their women; A rule, I feare not ſo well obſerved by Chriſtians , whereby not onely conceptions are prevented, but if they proceed, fo vitiated and defiled thatdurable inquinations, remaine upon the birth , which when the conception meets with theſe impurities , muſt needs be very potent , ſince in the pureſt and moſt faire conceptions, learned men derive the cauſe of Pox and Meazels, from principles of that nature, thatis, the menſtruous impurities in the mothers bloud, and the virulent tinRures contraed by the Infant, in the nutriment of the wombe. | Laſtly, experience will conviR it, for this offenſive odor is no way  44* diſcoverable in their Synagogues where many are, and by reaſon of IA theit number could not be concealed ; nor is the ſame diſcernible in commerce or converſation with ſuch as are cleanly in apparell, and de- | cent in their houſes ; ſurely the Viziars and Turkiſh Baſha's are not of this opinion, who as Sir Henry Blunt informeth, doc generally keepe a Jew of their private Counſell ; and were this true , the Jews them- —', 3 IRE {elves do not ſtrifly make out the intention of their Law, for in vaine "EE _ Cc2 do 3

do they ſcruple to approach the dead, who livingly are cadaverous, or feare any outward pollution, whoſe temper pollutes themſelves. And laſtly, were this truc, our opinion is not impartiall, for unto converted Jews whoare of the ſame ſeed, no man imputeth this unſavoury odor; 25 though Aromatized by their converſion, they admitted their ſent with their Religion, and they ſmelt no longer then they ſavourcd of the Jew. -
New the ground that begat or propagated this aſſertion might be the diſtaſtfull averſeneſle of the Chriſtian from the Jew , from their corruptneſſe, and the villany of that fat , which made them abomi- nable and ſtinck inthe noſtrils of all men; which reall practiſe,and me- raphoricall expreſſion, did after proceed into a litcrall conſtruRion; but was a fraudulent illation; for ſuch an evill ſavour their father Jacob acknowledged in himſelte , when he faid , his ſons had made him ſtinke in the land, that is, to be abominable unto the inhabitants there- of : Now how dangerous it is in ſenſible things to ule metaphoricall expreſſions unto the people , and what abſurd conceits they will ſwal- low intheir literals , an 1mpatient example wee have in our owne pro- teſhon , whorhaving called an eating Ulcer by the name of a Wolfe, common apprehenſion conceives a reality therein, and againſt our ſelves ocular affirmations are pretended to confirme it.
The naſtineſſe of that Nation, and fluttiſh courſe of life hath much promoted the opinion , occaſioned by their {ervile condition at firſt, and inferiour wayes of parſimony ever fince ; as is delivered by Mr.Sandys, They are generally fat, ſaith he, and ranck of the ſavours which attend upon ſluttiſh corpulency : The Epithites affigned them by ancient times have alſo advanced the ſamey tor Ammianus Marcel- linus deſcribeth them in ſuch lapguage , and Martiall more ancient, in ſuch a relative expreſſion ſets forth unſavoury Baſla,

Laſtly, if all were true, and were this ſavour conceded , yet are the reaſons alleadged for it no way ſatisfaRory : Hucherius in his TraR de ferilitate, and after him Alfarius Crucius in his medicall Epiſtles, im- pures this effe& unto their abſtinence from ſalt or ſale meats; which how to make good in the preſent dyct of the Jews we know not, nor ſhall we conceive it was obſerved of old, it we conſider they ſeaſoned evcry ſacrifice, and all oblations whatſoever,whereof we cannot deny

was ſalted no lefſe then thrice, that is,once in the common chamber of falt, at the footeſtep of the Altar, and upon the top thereof, as is at large delivered by Maimonides: gor if they refrained all ſalt, is the illation very urgent ; for many there are not noted for'ill odors, which eate no ſalt at all, as all carnivorous animals, moſt children, many whole Nati- ons, and probably our Fathers after the Creation, there being indeed in every thing we eate, a naturall and concealed ſalt, which is
ted by digeſtions, as doth appeare in our teares , ſweat and urines, al- though we refraine all ſalt, or what doth ſeeme to containe it. ty
Another cauſe is urged by Campegius, and much received by Chriſtians, that this ill ſavour is a curſe derived upon them by Chriſt, and ſtands as a badge or brand of a generation that crucified their Sal- vator; but this isa conceit without all warrant , and ancafie way to take off diſpute in what point of obſcurity ſoever: a method of Writers, which much depreciates the cſteeme and value of miracles, that is, therewith to ſalve not onely reall verities, but alſo non-exiſten- ces: Thus have elder times, not onely aſcribed the immunitie of Ire- land from any venemous beaſt, -unto the ſtaffe or rod of Patrick , bur the Jong tayles of Kent unto the malediRion of Auſtin, -
Thus therefore, although we concede that many opinions are true which hold ſome conformity unto this, yet in afſenting hereto, many difficulties muſt ariſe , it being a dangerous point toannex a conſtant

Julius Scaliger adiligent enquirer, accounts thereof, but as a Pocticall fition z Viyſles Aldrovandus a moſt exaRt Zoographer in an expreſle diſcourſe hereon, concludes the ſtory fabulous,and a poetical account of Hemer;and the ſame was for- merly conceived by Euſtathius his excellent commentator , Alberiue Magnw a man oftimes too credulous, herein was more then dubious, for he affirmeth, it any ſuch dwarfes were ever extant, they were ſure- | ly ſome kinde of Apes; which is a conccit allowed by Cardan,and not eſteemed improbable by many others. There are I confeſſe two teſtimonies , which from their antthority admitof conſideration. The firſt of Ariſtotle, whoſe words are theſe, in the eighth of his Hiſtory of animals , * 4 © n@ &c, That is, His locus oft quens incolunt Pygmer, now enim id fabula eſt. ſed puſillum genus, #t 4iunt, Wherein indeed Ariſtotle playes the Ariſtotle, that is , the wary and evading affertor; For though with »on eſt infbsls, he ſeem at firſt to confirme it, yet at the laſt he claps in, S/cut aivrt, and ſhakes the belicfe he put before upon it; and therefore I obſerve Scaliger hath not tranſlated the firſt, perhaps ſuppoſing it ſurreptitious, or unworthy ſogreatan aſſertor : and truely for thoſe bookes of animals,or worke of cight hundred talents , as Atheneus termes it , although it bee ever to bee admired , and containe moſt excellent truths, yet are many things therein delivered upon relation, and ſome things repugnant un- to the hiſtory of our ſenſes; as wee are able to make out in ſome , and Scaliger hath obſerved in many more, as he hath freely declared him- ſelfe in his Comment upon that peece. The ſecond teſtimony is deduced from holy Canonical! Scripture;

Laſtly,I ſay confirmed teſtimonies;for though Paalas Towine delivers there are Pygmies beyond Japan, Pigafeta, aboutthe Molucca's, and Olaus Magnus placeth them in Greenland , yet wanting frequent con- firmation in a matter ſo confirmable, their affirmation carrieth but ſlow perſwaſion; and wiſe men may thinke there is as much reallity in the Pygmies of Paracelſus, that is, his non- Adamicall men,or middle natures betwixt men and ſpirits.

ſixty three; which is conceived to carry with it, the moſt conſiderable fatality, and conſiſting of both the other numbers was apprehended to compriſe the vertue of either , is therefore expected and entertained with feare, and cſtcemed a favour of fate to paſſe it over which not- withſtanding many ſuſpeR to be but a Panick terrour, and mento feare they juſtly know not what; and for my owne part, to ſpeake indiffe- rently , I finde no ſatisfaRion, nor any ſufficiency in the received grounds to cſtabliſh a rationall teare.
Now herein to omit Aſtrologicall conſiderations (which are but rarely introduced)the popular foundation whereby it hath continued is firſt, the extraordinary power and ſecret vertue conceived to attend theſe numbers , whereof we muſt confeſle there have not wanted not onely eſpeciall commendations; but very ſingular conceptions. Among Philoſophers, Pythagoras ſeemes to have played:the leading part,! which was long after continued by his diſciples, and the Italicke Schoole, the Philoſophy of Plato, and moſt of the Platoniſts abound in numerall confiderationsz above all Philo the learned Jew, hath aQed this part even to ſuperſtition, beſtowing divers pages in ſumming up every thing which might advantage this number : All which not- withſtanding when a ſerious Reader ſhall perpend , hee will hardly finde any thing that may convince his judgement or any further per- (wade,then the lenity of his belief,or prejudgement of reaſon inclineth.
For firſt , not only the number of 7 and 9 from confiderations ab- ſtruſe have been extolled by moſt , but all or moſt of theother digits have been as myſtically applauded by many z for the number of one and three have not been only admired by the heathens, but from ado- rable grounds, the unity of God, and myſtery of the Trinity admired by many Chriſtians. The number of foure ſtands much admired not only in the quaternity of the Elements, which are the principles of bodies , but inthe letters ofthe name of God ,. which inthe Greeke, Arabian, Pcrſian, Hebrew, and Agyptian, confiſteth of that number; and was ſo venerable among the Pythagoreans, thatthey ſwore by the number foure. That of fix hath found many leaves in its favour ,' not only for the dayes of the Creation, but its naturall conſideration, . as being a perfeR number , and the firſt that is compleated by its parts; that is, the ſixt,the half,and the third, r. 2, 3. which drawne into a ſum make fix: The number of ten hath been as highly extolled.as containing even,odde,long and plaine, quadrate and cubicall numbers, and Ari- | ſtotle obſerved with admiration,that Barbarians as wellas Greeks, did uſe a numeration unto Tenzwhich being ſo generall was net to be jud- ged caſuall,but to have a foundation in nature: So that only 7 and 9,but all the reſt have had their Elogies,as may be obſerved at large in Rho- diginus,and in ſeverall Writers fince : every one extolling number,ac-

That verſe in Virgill tranſlated out of Homer, 0 #erg, quaterg, beati; thatis, as men will have it 7 times happy hath much advanced this number in criticall apprehenſions ;' yet is not this conſtruRion ſo indu- bitably to bereceived, as not at all to be queſtioned : for though Rho- diginus, Beroaldus & others from the authority of Macrobius ſo inter- pret it, yet Servius the beſt of hisComments conceives no more there- by then a finite number for indefinite,and that no more is implied then often happy. Strabo the ancienteſt of them all, inthe firſt of his Geo- graphy conceives no more by this expreſſion in Homer, then a full and exceſſive expreſſion;whereas in common phraſe and received language hee ſhould haye tearmed them thrice happy, herein exceeding that number he called them foure times happy that is more then thrice; and this he illuſtrates by the like exprefſion of Homer inthe of Circe, who to expreſle the dread and terrourof the Ocean, ſticks not unto the common forme of ſpeechin the ſtrict account of its recipro- cations, but largely ſpezking ſaith , it ebbes and lows no lefle then thrice a day, terg, die event alles iterumg, reſorbet; and ſo when cis ſaid by Horace, felices ter & ampline , the expoſition is ſufficient, if we conceive no morethen the letter fairely beareth,that is, foure times, or indefinitly more then thrice.

As for the motion of the Moon,though we grant it to be meaſured by ſevens, yet will not this advance the ſame before its fel- low numbers; for hereby the motion of others are not meaſured, the fixed Starres by many thouſand yeares, the Sunne by 365. dayes, the ſuperiour Planets by more, the inferiour by ſomewhat lefle: and if we conſider the revolution of the firſt Moveable,8 the daily motion from Eaſt to Weſt, common unto all the orbs,we ſhall find it meaſured by a- nother numbersfor being performed in four& twenty hours,it is made up of 4 times 6: and this is the meaſure and ſtaridard of other parts of

Againe, months are not onely Lunary, and meaſured by the Moon, but alſo Solary, and determined by the motion of the Sun, that is, the ſpace whereinthe Sun doth paſſe 30, degrees of the Eccliptick , by this month Hippocrates computed the time of the Infants geſtation in the wombe, for 9. times 30. that is, 270. dayes, or compleat 9.months make up forty weeks the common compute of women, and chis isto be underſtood io his booke De ocFimeſtri parts, when he laith, 2.dayes makes the fifteenth, and 3. the tenth part of a month ; this was the month of the ancient Hebrewes before their departure out-of Xgypt, and hereby the cornpute will fall out right, and the account concurre, when in one place it is ſaid , the waters of the flood prevayled an hun- dred and fifty dayes, and in another it is delivered, that they prevailed from the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond month , unto the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh : and as for weeks, although in regard of their Sab- boths they were obſerved by the Hebrewes, yet is it not apparent, the ancient Greeks, or Romans uſed any, but had another divifion of their months into Ides, Nones, and Calends.
Moreover, months howſoever taken are not exaRly diviſible into ſeptuaries or weeks, which fully containe ſeven dayes, whereof foure times do make compleatly twenty eight , for, befide the uſuall or Ca- lendary month, there are but foure conſiderable, that is, the month of Peragration, of Apparition, of Conſecution, and the medicall or De- cretoriall manth,whereof ſome come ſhort, others cxceed this account. A month of Peragration, isthetime of the Moones revolution from any part of the Zodiack, unto the ſame againe, and this containeth but 27. dayes, and about 8.howres, which commeth ſhort to compleat the ſeptenary account. The month of Conſecution, or as ſome will terme ic, of Progreſſion, is the ſpace betweene one conjunRion of the Moon with the Sun unto another, and this containeth 29.dayes and an halfe; for the Moone returning unto the ſame point wherein it was kindled by the Sun, and not finding it there againe, (for in the meane time, by ies proper motion it hath paſſed through 2. {ignes ) it followeth after, and attaines the Sun in the ſpace of 2. dayes, and 4. howres more, which added unto the account of Peragration, makes 29. dayes and an halfe z ſo that this month exceedeth the latitude of Septenaries, and the fourth part comprehendeth more then 7. dayes. A month of Appurition, is the ſpace wherein the Moone appeareth, ( deduRiog three dayes wherein it commonly difappeareth ; and being in combu- ſtion with the Sun,is preſumed of leſſe aRivity) and this containeth but 26. dayecs, and 12, howres. The Medicall month not much excce- deth this, conſiſting of 26.dayes, and 22. howres, and 1s made up out of all the other months, for if out of 29. and an halfe , the month of |- Conſecution,we deduR 3.dayes of diſappearance , there will remaine the month of Apparition 26, dayes, and 12. howres , whereto if wee

adde 27.dayes and 8. howres, the menth of Peragration, there will ariſe 5 3.daycs and 10. howres , which divided by 2. makes 26. dayes and 22.howres, called by Phyfitians the medicall month; introduced by Galen againſt Archigenes, for the better compute of Dectetory or
Criticall dayes. |
As for criticall dayes, (ſuch I meane wherein upon a decertation be- | tweene the diſeaſe and nature, there enſueth a ſenfible alteration, either | to life, or death) the reaſons thereof are rather deduced from Aſtrolo- oy, then Arithmetick ; for accounting from the beginning of the diſ- | caſe, and reckoning on unto the ſeventh day , the Moone will be in a | -1 Tetragonall or Quadrate aſpeR, that is, 4. ſignes removed from that | wherein the diſcaſe began, in the 14. day it will bee in an oppoſite | aſpeR, and atthe end of the third ſeptenary Tetragonall againe, as will | moſt graphically appearc inthe figures of Aſtrologets, eſpecially Lu- cas Gauricus, De diebws decretoriss.
Againe, (beſide that computing by the medicall month the firſt hebdotnade or ſeptenary conſiſts of 6. dayes, 17. howres andanhalfe, the ſecond happeth in 13. dayes and eleven howres, and the third bur in the twentieth ngturall day) what Galen firſt , and Aben-Ezra fince obſerved in his TraR of Criticall dayes, in regard of Eccentricity and | the Epicycle or teſſer orbe wherein it moveth, the motion of the Moone is various and unequall, whereby the criticall accoune muſt alſo | vary: for though its middle motion be equall, and of 13. degrees, yet , inthe other it moveth ſometimes fifteene, ſometimes lefle then twelve, formoving in the upper part of its orbe, it performeth its motion more {lowly then inthe lower , inſomuch that being at the height ic arriveth atthe Tetragonall and oppoſite fignes ſooner , and the Criticall day | will be in 6. and 13. and being at the loweft, the criticall account will be out of the latitude of 7.nor happen before the 8.or ninth day,which are conſiderations not to be negleRed in the compute of decretory dayes, and manifeſtly declare that other numbers muſt have a reſpeRt herein as well as 7. and fourteene.
Laſtly, ſome things to this intent are deduced from holy Scripture ; thus is the yeare of Jubilic introduced to magnifie this number, as be- ing a yeare made out of 7. times 7. wherein notwithſtanding there may | be a miſapprehenſion for this ariſeth not from 7.times 7. that is, 49. but was obferved the fifticth yeare, as is expreſſed, Levit.25. And you ſhall hallow the fiftieth yeare, a Jubilic ſhall that fifrieth yeare be unto you; anſwerable whereto is the expoſition of the Jews themſelves, asis delivered by Ben-maimon, that is, the yeare of Jubilie commeth pot intothe account of the years of 7.but the forty ninth is the Releaſe, and the fifticththe yeare of Jubilic. Thus is ic alſo eſteemed no {mall | advancement untothis number , that the Genealogy of our Saviour is ſummed up by 14. that is, this number doubled according as is _

ſed, Mat.1. Soall the generations from Abraham to David are foure. teene generations, and from David unto the carrying away into Baby. lon, are fourcteene generations, and from the carrying away into Ba bylon unto Chriſt, are fourteene generations, which nevertheleſſe muſt not be ſtriatly underſtood as numerall relations require ; for from David unto Jeconiah are accounted by Matthew but 14. generations, whereas according to the exaR account in the hiſtory ot Kings , there were at leaſt 17. and 3. inthis account, that is, Ahazias, Joas, and A. mazias are left out : for ſo it is delivered by the Evangeliſt ; And Jo- ram begat Ozias, whereas inthe Regall genealogy there are 3. ſuccel. fions betweene, for Ozias or U1zziah, was the ſon of Amazias, Ama- ziasof Joas, Joasof Azariah, and Azariah of Joram, ſo that in ſtri& account Joram was the Abayus or grandfather twice removed , and not the tatherof Ozias, and theſe omitted deſcents made a very con- fiderable meaſure of time, in the Royall chronology of Judah, for though Azariah reigned but one yeare, yet Joas reigned forty , and Amazias no lefſe then nine and twenty: However therefore thele were delivered by the Evangeliſt , and carry no doubt an incontroulable CY unto the intention of his delivery , yet | not appli-
| able unto preciſe numerality , nor ſtrictly to be drawne unto the rigid ceſt of numbers.
Laſtly, though many thiogs have beene delivered by Authors con- cerning number , and they transferred unto the advantage oftheir na» rure, yet are they oftimes otherwiſe to be underſtood, then as they are vulgarly received in aQive and cauſall confiderations z they being ma- ny times delivered Hieroglyphically, metaphorically, illuſtratively, and not with reference unto aQion, or cauſality. True it is, that God made all things in number, weight, and meaſure, yet nothing by them or through the efficacy of either s Indeed our dayes, aRions, and mo- tions being meaſured by time (which is but motion meaſured) what ever is obſervable in any , falls under the account of ſome number , which notwithſtanding cannot be denominated the cauſe of thoſe events ; and ſo doe we 1njuſtly afſigne the power of ARion even unto Time it ſelf, nor doe they ſpeake y__ who ſay that Time conſu- meth all things for Timeis not ve,nor are bodics deſtroyed by ie, but from the aRion and paſſion of their Elements in it, whoſe account ir onely affordeth, and meaſuring out their motion, informes us intheir periods and termes of their duration, rather then effeReth, or phyſi- cally produceth the ſame. .
A lecond conſideration which promoteth this opinion, are confir-
mations drawne from Writers , who have made obſervations or ſet downe favourable reaſons for this climaReeriall yeare z ſo have Henri- cus Ranzovins, Baytiſha Codronchus, and Levinus Lemnius much con- firmed the ſame ; but above all, that memorable Letter of _—

For firſt it is implicitely,and upon conſequence denyed by Ariftotle in his Politicks, in that diſcourſe againſt Plato, who meaſured the vi- ciſfitude and mutation of States , by a periodicall fataliry of number: Prolomie that famous Mathematicianplainly faith, he will not deliver his doQrines by parts and numbers which are ineffeRuall,and have not the nature of cauſes ; now by theſe numbers ſaich Rhodiginus and Mi- randula , he implyeth ClimaQericall years, that is,ſeptenaries,and no- venarics fet downe by the bare obſervation of numbers: Cenſorinus an Author of great authority, and ſufficient antiquitie, ſpeakes yet more amply in his booke De die Natal? , wherein expreſly treating of Cli- maRericall dayes , hee thus delivereth himſelfe: Some maintaine that 7. times 7. that is, 49. is moſt dangerous of any other , and chis is the moſt generall opinion, others unto 7. times 7. adde g. times 9g. that is, the yeare of $1. both which conſiſting of ſquare and quadrate num- |bers, were thought by Plato and others to bee of great confideration, as for this year of 63. or 7. times 9. though ſome efteeme it of moſt danger, yet do I conceive it leſſe dangerous then the other, for though it containeth both numbers above named, that is, 7. and 9. yet neither of them ſquare or quadrate,and as it is different from them both fo is it not potent in cicher : Nor is this yeare remarkable in the death of ma-' | by famous men. I finde indeed that Ariſtotle dyed this yeare,but hee' ! by the vigour of his minde , along time ſuſtained a naturall nfirmitie of ſtamack, that it was a greater wonder he attained unto 63. then that he lived nolonger: The Plalme of Moſes hath mentioned a yeare of danger differing fromall theſe: and chat is tentimes 7. or ſeventic; for ſoit is ſaid , The dayes of Man are threeſcore and ten; and the very ſame is affirmed by Solon, as Herodotus relates in a ſpeech of his unto Creſus, Egs annk ſeptuaginte hamane vite modum : and ſurely that yeare muſt be of greateſt danger , which is the Period of all the reſt, and feweſt ſafcly paſſe thorow that , which is ſet as a bound for few or noneto paſſe; and therefore the conſent of elder times , ſetling cheir conceits upon ClimaRers, not onely differing from this of ours,

' and therefore as Seneca delivereth, the Magicians at Athens did ſacri- fice unto him,as declaring in his death ſomewhat above humanity, be- cauſe he dyed in theday of his nativity , and without deduRion juftly accompliſhed the year of eighty one. Bodine I confeſle delivers a lar- ger liſt of men that died in this yeare , whoſe words in his methode of Hiſtory are theſe, Morinntur innumerabiles anno ſexageſimotertis, Ati- ſtoteles, Chryfippus, Bocatius, Bernardus , Eraſmus, Lutherus, Me- lanRhon, Sylvius, Alexander, Jacobus Sturmius, Nicolaus Cuſfanus, Thomas Linacer , eodews anno Cicero ceſus eſt : wherein beſide that it were no difficult point to make a larger Catalogue of memorable per- ſons that dyed in other yeares , wee cannot but doubt the verity of his InduRion: as for Silvius and Alexander, which of that name he mean- eth I know not; but for Chryſippus by the teſtimony of Laertius, hee dyed inthe 73. year, Bocatius inthe 62. Linacer the 64. and Eraſmus exceeded 70. as Paulus Jovius hath delivered in his Elogie of learned \ men; and as for Cicero, as Plutarch in his life affirmeth,he was ſlain tn the year of 64.and therefore ſure the queſtion is hard fer, and we have | no eaſie reaſon to doubt, when great and entire Authors ſhall introduce | . , injuſtifiable examples, and authorize their aſſertions by what is not au- thenticall. |

rous CharaQer on ſuch as arive unto its it will leave ſome doubt be- hinde, in what ſubjeRion hereunto were the lives of our forefathers preſently after the flood, and more eſpecially before it, who attaining unto $. or 900, yeares, had not their ClimaQters computable by di gits, or as we doe account them, for the great ClimaQericall was paſt unto them before they begat children, or gave any Teſtimony of their yirilitic; for weread not that any __ children before the age of fix. tie five, and this may alſo afford a hint to enquire , what are the Cli. macers of other animated creatures, whereof the lives of ſome attaine not ſo farre asthis of ours, and that of others extends a conſiderable ſpace beyond.
Laſtly, the imperfeR accounts that men have kept of time, and the difference thereot both in the ſame and divers common wealths , will much diſtraR the certainty of this afſertion, for though there were a fatality in this yeare, yet divers were, and others might bee out in their account, aberring ſeverall wayes from the true and juſt compute, and calling that one yeare,which perhaps might be another.
For firſt they might be out in the commencement or beginning of their accoſit, for every man is many moneths elder then he computeth, for although we begintche ſame from our nativitie , and conceivethat no arbitrary,but naturall terme of compute, yet for the duration of life, or exiſtence , wee participate in the wombe the uſuall diſtinRions of time , and are not to bee exempted from the account of ape and life, where we arc ſubjeR to diſcaſes, and often ſuffer death z and thefefore Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Diocles, Avicenna and others, have ſet upon

aine, in regard of the meaſure of time by monthsand years, there will be no ſmall difficulty, and if we ſhall ſtrily confider it, many have been and ſtill may bee miſtaken; for neither the motion of the Moone, whereby months are computed , nor of the Sunne whereby yeares are accounted conſiſteth of whole numbers, but admits of frai- ons, and broken parts, as we have declared of the Moone. That of the Sunne conliſteth of 365. dayes, and almoſt 6 houres, that is wanting eleven minutes; which 6 houres omitted, or not taken notice of, will in proceſſe of time largely deprave the compute ; and this is the occafion of the Biſſextile or leap-yeare, which was not obſerved in all times,nor punRually in all Common- wealths; ſo that in 63.” yeares there may be loſt almoſt 18. dayes, omitting the intercalation of one day every fourth yeare, allowed for this quadrant, or 6 houres ſupernumerary : and though the ſame were obſerved , yet to ſpeake ſtritly a man may be ſomewhat out in the account of his age at 63. for although ey fourth yeare we inſert one day, and fo ferch up the quadrant, yet thoſe eleven minutes whereby the yeare comes ſhort of perfeRt 6 houres, will in the circuit of thoſe yeares arilc unto certaine houres, and ina larger progreſſion of time unto certaine dayes, whereof at preſent wee finde experience inthe Calender we obſerve ; for the Julian yeare of 365. daycs being eleven minutes larger then the annuall revolution of the Sunne , there will ariſe an anticipation in the Aquinoxes , and as JunRinus computeth in every 136. yeare they will anticipate almoſt one day z and therefore thoſe ancient men and Neſtors of old times, which yearly obſerved their nativities, might be miſtaken in the day, nor that to be conſtrued without a graine of Salr, which is delivered by Moſes inthe Booke of Exodus , At the end of foure hundred yeares, eventhe ſelfe ſame day, all the hoaſt of Iſrael went out of the land of Aoypt z for inthat ſpace of time the Equinoxes had anticipated, and the eleven minutes had amounted far above aday; and this compute rightly conſidered will fall fouler on them who caſt up the lives of Kingdomes , and ſumme uptheir duration by particular numbers as Plato firſt began, and ſome have endeavoured fince by perfeR and ſphericall numbers by the ſquare and cube of 7 and 9 and 1 2,thegreat number of Plato : whercin indeed Bodine hath attempted a particular enumeration , whereby notwithſtanding befide the miſtakes commit- tible in the ſolary compute of yeares, the difference of Chronologic diſturbes the ſatisfaRion and quiet of his computes, ſome adding , 0- thers detraRting , and few punRually according in any one yeare, whereby indeed ſuch accounts ſhould be made up, for the variation in one unity deſtroyes the rotall illation.
Thirdly, the compute may be unjuſt not only in a tri acception, or few dayes or houres, but in the latitude alſo of ſome yeares, and this may happen from the different —_— of yeares in divers _

Book 4. and even ſuch as did maintaine the moſt probable way of account, their yeare being not only different from one another , butthe civill and common account diſagreeing much from the naturall yeare, whereon the conſideration is founded : Thus from the teſtimony of Herodotus, Cenſorinus and others,the Greeks obſerved the Lunary yeare, that is, twelve revolutions of the Moone 354. dayes, but the Agyptians, and many others adhered unto the Solary account, that is, 365. dayes,that is eleven dayes longer; now hereby the account of the one would very much exceed the other : A man in the one would account himſelfe 63. when one in the other would thinke himſelfe but 61. and ſo although their nativities were under the ſame houre , yet did they at different yeares believe the verity of that which both cſteemed affixed and cer- taine unto one : The like miſtake there is ina tradition of our dayes; men conceiving a peculiar danger in the beginning dayes of May, which are ſet out as a fatall period unto conſumptions and Cronicall diſeaſes; wherein notwithſtanding we compute by Calenders, not on- ly different from our anceſtors, but one another, the compute of the one anticipating that of the other z ſo that while wee arc in Aprill, others begin May, and the danger is paſt unto one, while it beginneth with another, |
Fourthly, men were not only out in the number of ſome dayes, the latitude of a few yeares, but might be wide by whole Olympiades and divers Decades of yeares; for as Cenſorinus relateth, che ancient Ar- cadians obſerved a yeare of three months, the Carians of ſix, the Ibe- rians of foure ; and as Diodorus and Xenophon, de Zquivecs allead- geth, the ancient Agyptians have uſed a yeare of three, two, and one month, ſo that the ClimaRericall was not only different unto thoſe Nations, but unreaſonably diſtant from ours; for 63. will paſſe in their account, before they arive ſo high as ten in ours.
Nor if we ſurvey the account of Rome it ſelfe, may we doubt they were miſtaken, and ifthey feared climaRericall ycares might erre in their numeration, for the civill yeare whereof the people took notice, did ſometime come ſhort, and ſometimes exceed the naturall, for as ir appeares by Varro, Suctonius, and Cenforinus, their yeare conſiſted firſt of ten months which comprehended but 304. dayes , that is 61. leſſe then ours containeth ; after by Numa or Tarquine from a ſuper- ſtitious conceit of impariety were added 51. dayes, which made 355. one day more then twelve revolutions of the Moone ; and thus a1 eime it continued , the civill compute exceeding-the naturall; the cor- re&ion whereof , and the due ordering of the leap-yeare was referred | unto the Pontifices, who cither upon favour or malice, that ſome | might continue their offices a longer or ſhorter time, or from the max. | nicude of the yeare that men might bee advantaged or endamaged 1 |

account; of this abule Ciceroacculed Verres, which at laſt proceeded ſo farre that when Julius Czlar came unto that office before the re- drefſe hereof he was taine to inſert two intercalary months unto No- | vember and December, when he had already inſerted 23. dayes unto February ; ſo that that year conſiſted of 445. dayes; a quarter of a year longer then that we oblerve, and though at the laſt the year was refor- med, yet in the meane time they might be oyt, wherein notwithſtand- ing they ſummed up ClimaRericall obſervations.
Laſtly, one way more there may be of miſtake, and that not unuſu- all among us, grounded upon a double compute of the yeare ; the one beginning from the 25. of March, the other from the day of our birth unto the ſame againe , which is the naturall account : Now hereu many men doe frequently miſcaſt their dayes; for in their age they di- duce the account not from the day of their birth , but the yeare of our Lord, whereinthey were borne ; ſo a man that was borne in January, | 1582. if hee liveto fall ficke in the latter end of March, 2645. will ſumme up his age, and ſay I am now 63. and in my ClimaQericall and dangerous yeare, for I was borne in the yeare 1582. and now it is 1645. whereas indeed he wanteth many months of that yeare, conſi- deting the true and naturall account unto his birth, and accounteth two months for a year : and though the length of time and accumulation of yeares doe render the miſtake inſenfible, yet is it all one, as if one borne in January 1644. ſhould be accounted a yeare old the 25. of March, 1645.
All which perpended, it may beeafily perceived with what infecu- rity of rruth we adhere unto this opinion,aſcribing not only effects de- pending on the naturall period of time unto arbitrary calculations, and ſuch as vary at pleaſure, but confirming our tenents by the uncertaine account of others and our ſelves; there being no poſitive or indiſpute- able ground where to begin our compute , that if there were , men might and have been ſeverall wayes miſtaken , the beſt in ſome lati- tude, others ingreater, according to the different compute of divers ſtates, the ſhort and irreconcilable yeares of ſome, the exceeding error in the naturall frame of others, and the lapſes and falſe deduQtions of ordinary accountants in moſt.

Now from the riſing of this ſtarre not coſmically, that is with the
. j4ASA Vu
Sun, bat Heliacally, that is, its emerſton from the rayes of the Sunne, the Ancients computed their canicular dayes; concerning which there generally paſſeth an opinion, that during thoſe dayes, all medication or uſe of Phyſick is to be declined, and the cure committed unto Nx cure, and therefore as though there were any feriation in nature or ju- ſtiriums imaginable in profeſſions, whoſe ſubjeR is naturall, and under no intermiffive, but conſtant way of mutation; this ſeaſon is common- ly termed the Phyfitians vacation,and ſtands fo received by moſt men: | which conceit however generall, is not =_ erroneous, but unnatu- rall, and ſubſiſting upon toundations cither falſe, uncertaine, miſtaken, or miſapplicd , deſerves not of mankinde that indubitable aſſent it findeth.
For firſt, which ſeemes to be the ground of this afſertion , and not to be drawne into queſtion,that is, the magnified quality of this Starre conceived to-cauſe or intend the heat of this ſeaſon, whereby theſe dayes become more obſervable then the reſt, we finde that wiſer An- tiquity was not ofthis opinion, which ſeven hundred yeares agoc was error rejected by Geminus, a learned Mathematician in his

2nd alterations proceed from thoſe ſtars, which were indeed but de- ſignations of ſuch quarters and portions ofthe yeare, wherein the ſame were obſerved: Now what Pliny affirmeth of the Orix, that it ſeemeth to adore this ſtar, and taketh notice thereof by yoyce and ſternutation, untill wee be betrer aſſured of its verity, wee ſhall not ſalve the ſym- thy.
AY what ſlender opinion the Ancients held of the efficacy of this ſtarre is declarable from their compute, for as Geminus affirmeth, and Petavius his learned Comment proveth, they began their account from its Heliacall emerfion, and not its coſmicall aſcent The coſmi
call aſcenſion of a ſtarre we terme that , when it ariſeth together with the Sun, or the ſame degree of the Ecliptick wherein the Sun abideth: and that the Heliacall, when a ſtarre which before for the vicinity ot
for the annuall motion of the Snn from Weſt to Eaſt being far {wifter then that of the fixed ſtars, he muſt of neceſſity leave them on the Eaſt whilſt he haſtneth forward, and obſcureth others to the Weſt : and ſo the Moone who performes its motion ſwifter then the Sun, (as may be | obſerved in their ConjunRions and Eclipſes) gets Eaſtward out of hs raycs, and appeares when the Sun is ſet ; if therefore the Dog-ſtar had this efieRuall heat which is aſcribed unto i, it would afford beſt evi- | dence thereof, and the ſeaſon would be moſt fervent, when it ariſeth in the probableſt place of its aRivity, that is, the coſmicall aſcent, for therein it ariſeth with the Sun, and is included in the ſame irradiation: | but the time obſerved by the Ancients was long after this aſcent, and inthe Heliacall emerfion, when it becomes at greateſt diſtance from the Sun, neither riſing with it norneere it; and therefore , had they conceived any more then a bare ſignality in this Star, or aſcribed the heat of the ſeaſon thereunto, they would not have computed from its Heliacall aſcent which was of inferiour efficacy, nor imputed the vehe- mency of heat unto thoſe points wherein it was more remifle, and where with leſſc probability they might make out its aRion.
Thirdly, although we derive the authority of theſe dayes from ob- ſervations of the Ancients, yet are our computes very different, and {uch as confirme not each other, for whereas they obſerved it Hcliacal- ly, we obſerve it Coſmically ; for before it ariſeth Heliacally unto our latitude, the Summer is evenat anend : Againe, we compute not one- ly trom different aſcents, but alſo from divers ſtarres, they from the greater Dop-ſtar, we from the leſſer; they from Orions, we from Ce- phalus his dog; they from Seirius, we from Procyon ; for the begin-| ning of the Dog-dayes with us is ſet downe the 19. of July , at which time the leſſer Dog-ſtar ariſeth with the Sun, whereas the ſtarre of the greater Dog aſcendethnot untill about the 31. of July , in the 18. de- gree of Leo ; and the joyne compute by both is onely a” in =

latitude of 30. degrees where boththele ſtarres ariſe together, So that their obſervations confirme not ours , nor ours theirs, but rather con- tute eachother,computing from different foundations, and tranſlating at pleaſure the «ffcs and power of one ſtarre unto another.
Fourthly , { which is the Argument of Gemiaus) were there any ſuch effeQuall heat in this ſtarre, yet could it but weakly evidence the ſame in Summer, it being about 40. degrees diſtant from the Sun,and ſhould rather manifeſt its warming power in the winter, when it remaines conjoyned with the Sun in'its Hybernall converſion , for about the 29. of October, and in the 16. of Scorpius, and ſo againe in January the Sunne performes his revolution in the ſame parallel! with the Dogge-ſtarre z Againe, if wee ſhould impute the heat of this ſea- ſoo,unto the cooperation of any ſtarres with the Sunne,it ſeemes more favourable for our times, to aſcribe the ſame unto the conſtellation of Leoz where beſides that the Sunne is in his proper houſe, it is conjoined with many ſtarres, whereof two of the farſt itude, and inthe 84 of Auguſt is corporally conjoyned with Bafiliſcus, a ſtarre of eminent name in Aſtrologie, and ſeated in the very Eclipticke.
Fifthly,if all were granted,that obſervation and reaſon were alſo for it, and were it an undeniabletruth that aneffecuall fervour proceeded from this ſtarre, yet would not the ſame determine the opinion now in queſtion, it neceſſarily ſuffering ſuch reſtriQions as take of generall il- lations; for firſt in regard of different latitudes unto ſome, the canicular dayes are inthe winter , as unto ſuch as have no latitude , but live in a right Sphere that is under the AquinoGiall line z for untothem ir ari- ſeth with the Sunne about the Tropicke of Cancer, which ſeaſon unto them is winter, and the Sunne remoteſt from them : nor hath the ſame poſition inthe ſummer , that is, in the AquinoRiall points any advan- tage from it;for in the one point the Sunne is at the Meridian , before the Dogge-ſtarre ariſcth , inthe other the ſtarre is at the Meridian be- fore the Sunne aſcendeth,
Some latitudes have no canicular dayes at all ; as namely all thoſe which have more then 73. degrees of northerne Elevation, as the terri- tory of Nows Zembla,part of Greenland and Tartaric; for unto that ha- vieation the Dogge-ſtarre is inviſible , and appeareth not above the Horizon:
Unto ſuch Latitudes as it ariſeth, it carrieth a various and a very dif- ferent reſpeR; unto ſome it aſcendeth when Summer is over, whether we compute Heliacally or Coſmically ; for though unto Alexandria it ariſeth in Cancer, it ariſeth not unto Biarmia Coſmically before it bee io Virgo, and Heliacally about the Autumnall zquinox ; even unto. the Latitude of 52. the efficacy thereof is not much conſt- derable , whether we conſider its aſcent , Meridian altitude, or abode above the Horizon, for it ariſcth very = in the yecre,about the cigh-

teenth of Leo, that is, the 31. of Iulyz Of Meridian Altitude it hath bur 23. degrees, ſo that it playes bur obliquely upon us, and as the Sun doth about the 23.0f January,and laſtly his abode above the Horizon is not great; for inthe eighteenth of Leo,the 31. of Iuly,although they ariſe together, yet doth it ſet above 5. houres beforethe Sun, that is, before two of the clock, after which time we are more ſenſible of heat, then all the day before.
Scondly, in regard of the variation of the longitude of the ſtarres, | we are to confider(what the Ancients obſcrved not )that the fice of the fixed ſtarres is alterable , and that ſince elder times they have ſuffered a large and conſiderable variation of their longitudes; the longitude of 2 ſtarre to ſpeake plainly, isits diſtance from the firſt point of numera- * tion toward the Eaſt, which firſt point unto the Ancients was the ver- | nall zquinox; Now by reaſon of their motion from Weſt ro E1ſt,they have very muchvaried from this point : The firſt ſtarre of Aries in the rime of Meton the Athenian was placed in the very interſcRion, which | | is now elongated and removed Eaſtward 28. degrees; inſomuch that
now the figne of Aries poſſeſſeth the place of Taurus, and Taurus that |
| of Gemini ; which variation of longitude muſt very much diſtraR the
opinion of the Dogge-ſtarre , not onely in our dayes, but in times be-
fore and after; for fince the world began it hath ariſen in Taurus, and
before it end may have its aſcent in Virgo fo that wee muſt place the
canicular dayes, that is the hotteſt time of the year in the ſpring io the fiiſt Age. and inthe Autumne in the ages to come.
Thirdly,the ſtarres have not onely varied their longitudes,whereby | their aſcents have altered ; but have alſo changed their declination, |
whereby their rifiog at all , that is, their appearing hath varied. The longitude of a ſtarre wee call its ſhorteſt diſtance fromthe Aquator, Now though the poles of the world and the Aquator be immoveable, yet becaule the ſtarres in their proper motions, from Weſt to Eaſt doe move upon the poles of the Eclipticke diſtant 23. degrees and an half from the poles of the Aquator, and deſcribe circles parallell not unto the Aquator,butthe Eclipticke, they muſt be therfore ſometimes nez- rer, ſometimes removed further from the Aquator: All ſtarres that
have their diſtance from the Eclipticke Northward not more then 23. degrees and an halfe, which is the greateſt diſtance of the Eclipticke fromthe Aquator, may in progreſſion of time have declination South- ward , and move beyondthe Aquator: but if any ſtarre hath juſt this diſtance of 23. and an halfe, as hath Cappella on the backe of Eciho- nius,it may hereafter move under the AquinoQiall, and the ſame will happen reſpeRively unto ſtarres which have declination Southward : and therefore many ftarres may be viſible in our Hemiſphere , which are not ſo at preſent, and many which are at preſent, ſhall take leave of
| our Horizon , and appeare unto Southerne habitations ; and therefore kne

the time may come that the Dogge-ſtarre may not be viſible in our Horizon, and the time hath beene , when it hath not ſhewed it ſelfe unto our neighbour latitudes, ſo that canicular dayes there have beene none nor ſhall be , yet certainely in all times ſome ſeaſon of the yeare more notable hot then other. Laſtly , wee multiply cauſes in vaine, for the reaſon hereof wee need not have recourſe unto any ſtarre but the Sunne and the continu tie of itsaRion : For the Sunne aſcending into the Northerne fignes, begetteth firſt a temperate heat in the ayre , which by his approach unto the ſolſtice he intendeth, and by continuation increaſeth the ſame even upon declination; tor running over the ſame degrees again,that is in Leo,which hee hath done in Taurus,io July which he did inMay,he menteth the heat inthe later which he began in the firſt, and eaſily intendeth the ſame by continuation which was well promoted before: So is it obſerved that they which dwell between the Tropicks and the Equator , have their ſecond ſuramer hotter and more maturative of fruits thenthe former : ſo we obſerve in the day (which is a ſhort yeer) the greateſt heat about two in the afternoone , when the Sunne is _=_ the Meridian ( which is his diurnall Solſtice ) and the ſame is evident from the Thermometer or obſervations of the weather-glaſſe; ſo are the colds of the night ſharper in the ſummer about ewo or three after midnight,and the froſts in winter ſtronger about thoſe houres : ſo like- wiſe in the yeare we obſerve the cold to augment, when the dayes be- ginto increaſe,though the Sunne bethen aſcenſive,and returning from the winter Tropick, and therefore if wee reſt not in this reaſon for the lheat in the declining part of ſummer, we muſt diſcover freezing ſtars that may reſolve the latter colds of winter, which who ever deſires to invent, let him ſtudie the ſtarres of Andromeda, or the nearer conſtel- lation of Pegaſus, which are about that time aſcendent.
It cannot therefore unto reaſonable conſtruQions ſeeme ſtrange, or lavowr of fingularity that we have examined this point, ſince the ſame hath beene already denyed by ſome , fince the authoritie and ob- (ervations of the Ancients rightly underſtood doe not confirme it, ſince our preſent computes are different from thoſe of the Ancients, whereon notwithſtanding they depend; ſince thereis reaſon againſt ir, and if all were granted , yet muſt it be maintained manifold re- ſtraints, farre otherwiſe then is reccived , and laſtly ſince from plaine and naturall principles, the doubt may be fairely ſalved, and got clapt up from petitionary foundations and principles uneſtabliſhed.
Bur that which chiefly promoted the confideration of theſe dayes, and medically adyanced the ſame , was the doQrine of Hippocrates a Phyſicion of ſuch repute, that he received a teſtimony from a Chriſti- an, that might have beene given unto Chriſt : The firſt in his booke

And in- deed ſhould we blindly obey the reſtraints both of Phyſitions and Aſtrologers, we ſhould contra the liberty of our preſcriptions , and confine the utility of Phyficke unto a very few dayes;for obſerving the Dogdayes, and as is expreſſed ſome dayes before , and likewiſe tenne dayes before, and after the AquinoRiall and Solfticiall points, by this obſervation alone are exempted above an hundred dayes ; whereunto if we adde the two Xgyptian dayes in every moneth , the interlunary and pleniluary exemptions, the Eclipſes of Sunne and Moone , con- junRions and oppoſitions Planeticall,the houſes of Planets,and the ſite of the Luminaries under the fignes, (wherein ſome would induce a re- ſtraint of Purgation or Phlebotomy) there would ariſe aboue an hun- dred more; ſo that of the whole year the uſc of Phyficke would not be ſecure much above a quarter, now as we doe not ftriatly obſerve theſe dayes, ſo need we not the other, and although conſideration bee made hereof, yet might wee preſerve the nearer Indications , before thoſe which are drawn from the time of the year,or other czleſtial relation.

Now fince that time (as we have already declared ) the Starres have varied cheir longicudes , and having madelarge progreffions from Weſt to Eaſt, the time of the Dogſtars aſcent muſt alſo very machalterz forir ariſerh later now in the yeare,then it formerly did in the ſame latitude, and far later unto us who have a greater elevation z for in the dayes of Hippocrates this Starre aſcended in Cancer which now ariſeth in Leo, and will in progreſſion of time ariſe in Virgo and therefore in _ of the time wherein he lived,the Aphoriſme was more confiderable in his dayes then it is fo us, or unto his country in ours.
The place of his nativity wasCoos,an Iland in the Myrtoan Sea,not far from Rhodes, deſcribed in Mappes by the name of Lango, and called by theTurkes who are maſters thereof Stancora, according unto | Ptolomie of Northerne latitude 36. degrees; that he lived and writ in theſe parts, is not improbably colleRed from the Epiſtles that paſſed
| 229 |
betwixt him and Artaxerxes, as alſo between the Citizens of Abdera, and Coos, inthe behalfe of Democritus ; which place being ſeated from our latitude of 52, 16 degrees Sourthward,there will ariſc a diffe. rent conſideration , and we may much deceive our ſelves if we con- forme the aſcent of Statres in one place unto another, or con- ceive they ariſe the ſame day of the moneth in Coos and in England; | for as Petavius corhputes in the firſt Julian yeare, at Alexandria of la- titude 31. the Starre aroſe coſmically inthe twelfe degree of Cancer, Heliacally the 26. by the compute of Geminus about this time at Rhodes of latitude 37. it aſcended coſmically the 16 of Cancer, Helia- cally the fiiſt of Leoz and about that time at Rome of latitude 42. col- mically the 22. of Cancer and Heliacally the firſt of Leo, for unto pla- ces of greater latitude it ariſeth ever ater, ſo that in ſome latitudes the coſmicall aſcent Rappeneth not before the twentieth degree of Virgo,
ten dayes before the Autumnall AXquinox,and if they compute Helia- cally after itin Libra. |
Againe, ſhould we allow all, and only compute unto the latitude of Coos, yet would it not impoſe atotall omiſſion of Phyſicke; for if in the hotteſt ſeaſon of that clime, all Phyſicke'wereto be declined, then ſurely in many other,none wereto be uſed at any time whatſoever, for vnto many parts , not only inthe Spring and Autumne, but alſo in the Winter the Sun is nearer,then unto the clime of Coos inthe mer.
The third conſideration concerneth purging medicines, whictare at preſent far different from thoſe implyedin this Aphoriſme, and ſuch as were commonly uſed by H.ppocrates ;. for three degrees wee make of purgative medicines : The firſt thereof is very benigne, nor far re- | moved from the nature of Aliment, into which-upon defeR of work-
ing, it is oft times converted, and in this forme do we account Matina,
fo Caſlia, |
'
230 | Enquiries into Pulgar Book "=
Caſſia, Tamarindes and many more , whereof we finde no mention in Hippocrates : the ſecond is alſo gentle, having a familiarity with ſome humor, into which it is but converted if it faile of its operationy of this ſort are Aloe, Rhabarbe, Scnna,&c. whercof alſo few or none were knowne unto Hippocrates : Thethird is of a violent and yenemougs quality, which fruſtrate of its ation, aflumes as it were the nature of poyſon, ſuch as are Scammoneum, Colocynthis, Elaterium, Euphor- bium, Tichymallus, Laurcola, Peplum, 8&c. of this fort it is manifeſt Hippocrates made uſc,even in Fevers,Pleurifies and Quinſies; and that
compoſition is very remarkable which is aſcribed unto Diogenes in | A:ius,that is of Pepper,Sal Armoniac, Euphorbium, of each an ounce, | the Doſis whereof foure ſcruples and an half,which whoſoever ſhould cake , would finde in his bowells more then a canicular heat though in che depth of Winter, many of the like nature may be obſcryed in Ati- us Tetrab.1.Serm.3. or in the book De Dinamidis aſcribed unto Ga- len, which is the ſame verbatim with the other.
Now in regard of the ſecond , and eſpecially the firſt degree of | | Purgatives, the Aphoriſme is not of force , but we may ſatcly uſe them , they being benigne and of innoxious qualities ; and therefore | Lucas Gauricus, who hath endeavoured with many teſtimonies tro advance this conſideration, at length concedeth that lenitive Phy- ſicke may bee uſed, eſpecially when the Moone is well affeRed in Cancer or inthe watery fignes ; but in regard of the third degree the Aphoriſme is conſiderable ; purgations may be dangerous, and a me- morable ex3mple there is in the medicall Epiſtles of Crucius, of a Ro- man Prince that dyed upon an ounce of Diaphznicon, taken in this ſeaſon; from the uſe whereof we refraine not only in hot ſeaſons, but watily exhibit it at all times in hot diſeaſes, which when neceſſity re- quires we can performe more ſafely then the Ancients,as having better wayes of preparation and correRion ; that is, not enely by addition of other bodyes, but ſeparation of noxious parts from their own.
But beſide theſe differences between Hippocrates and us , the Phy- ſitians of theſe times and thoſe of Antiquity, the condition of the dil- caſe, and the intention of the Phyſician, holds a maine confiderationin what time and place ſoever : for Phyſicke is cither curative or preven- tive; Preventive we call that which by purging noxious humors, and the cauſes of diſcaſcs preventeth ſickneſſe inthe healthy, or the rc- courſe thereof in the valetudinary z and this 15 of common uſe both at che Sprihg and Fall , and we commend not the ſame at this ſeaſon: [Therapeuticke or curative Phyſicke,we tearm that which reſtorcth the \ Patient unto ſanity, and taketh away diſeaſes aQually affeRing ; now of diſeaſes ſome are cronicall and of long duration, as quartane Agues, Scuryy,8c. wherein becauſe they admit of delay we deferre the cure | S more advantagious ſeaſons : others wee tearme acute , _ of | or

And although Aſtrologie may here put in, and plead the ſecret in- fluence of this Starre; yet Galen I perceive in his Comment, makes no ſuch conſideration, confirming the truth of the Aphoriſme from rhe heat of the yeare, and the operation of Medicines exhibited, io regard: that bodies being heated by the Summer, cannot fo well endurethe acrimony of purging Medicines, and becauſe upon purgations contrary motions enſue, the heat of the Ayre attrating the humours outward, and the aRion of the Medicine retraRing the ſame inward : but theſe are readily falved in the diſtinRiont before alleadged , and partictlar- ly inthe conſtitucionof our climate and divers others, wherein the Ayre makes no ſuch exhauſtion of ſpirits; add in the benignity of | our Medicines, whereof ſome in their owne natures , others well | prepared , agitate not the humours, or make a ſenſible pertur- | bation. | Nor do we hereby rejeR or condemne a ſober and r ed Aſtro-
logyz we hold there is more truth therein then in Aſtrologers, in ſome more then many allow, yet in none ſo much as ſome pretend ; we deny. not the influence of the Stars , but often ſuſpeR the due application thereof; for though we ſhould affirme that all things were in all things, that heaven were but carth celeſtificd , and earth but heaven terreſtri- | | fied, or that cach part above had an influence upon its devided affinity | below ; yet how to fingle out theſe relations, and duely to apply their |
aQions is a worke oft times to be effeRed by ſome revelation, and Ca- <f bala from above, rather then any Philoſophy, or ſpeculation here be- low ; what power ſoever they have upon our bodies, it is not requiſite they ſhould deſtroy our reaſons, that is,to make us rely on the ſtrength "j of Nature, when ſhe is leaſt able to relieve us, and when we conceive | the heaven againſt us, to refuſe the aſſiſtance of the earth created for |
usz this were to ſuffer from the mouth of the Dog above, what others | Upon the bi doe from the teeth of Dogs below that is, to be afraid of their proper | tn of » mad remedy, and refuſe to approach any water, though that hath often pro- | 552 ages ved a cure unto their diſeaſe. There isin wiſe men a power beyond | phobia or tear the ſtars; and Pcolomy encourageth us, that by fore-knowledge, wee | ** "***: may evade their aQions z for, being but univerſall cauſes, they are de- termined by particular agents , which being inclined not conſtrained, containe within themſelves the caſting aR , and a power to command | the concluſion,

tie and pittic among the Agyptians, on which conſideration, they ſpa- | red them at their tables. | . . Notwithſtanding upon enquirie we finde no mention hereof in An-
cient Zoographers, and ſuch as have particularly diſcourſed upon Ani- | mals, as Ariſtotle, Xlian, Plinie, Solinus and many more,who ſeldom
forget proprietics of ſuch a nature, and have beene very punuall in
lefſe conſiderable Records : Some ground hereof I confeſſe wee may
allow, nor need wee deny a remarkeable affeRion in Pelecans toward
their young; for Z&lian diſcourſing of Storkes , and their affeRion to-
ward their brood whom they inſtruR to flie, and unto whom they re-
deliver up the proviſion of their bellies,concludeth at laſt, that Herons
and Pelecans do the like.
As for the teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, and Ecclefiaſticall wri- ters,we may more ſafely conceive therein ſome Emblematicall then any reall Storie: ſo doth Eucherius confeſle it to bee the Embleme of |
|
Chriſt; and wee are unwilling literally to reccive that account of Je- rome, that perceiving her young ones deſtroyed by Serpents,ſhe open- | eh her fide with her bill, by the blood whereof they revive and return | unto life againe; by which relation they might indeed illuſtrate the de-

As for the Hicroglyphick ofthe Egyptians , they erected the ſame upon another Story, that is, from carneſtly proteting her young, when
aſſertion of the Egyptians,but ſeemes tranſlated unto the Pelecan from the Vulture.as Picrius hath moſt plainly delivered. Sed quod Pelicanum (nt etiam alijs pleriſg, perſueſum eſt) reſtro pettus diſſecamem pingunt, ita ut ſao ſanguine filios alat , ab Xgyptiorum hiftoria valde alienum eſt, ill enim vulturem tantum id facere tradiderunt.
And laſtly,as concerning the piRure, if naturally ex1mined,and not | Hiereglyphically conceived, it containeth many impropricties, diſa- | greceing almoſt in all things from the true and proper deſcription: for | fiiſt , whereas it is commonly ſet forth green or yellow, in its proper | colour, it is inclining to white, excepting the cxtreamitics or tops ; of the wing feathers, which are black: It is deſcribed in the big- ; neſſe of a Henne, whereas it approacheth and ſometimes exceedeth
the magnitude of a Swanne it is commonly painted with a ſhort bill, | whereas that of the Pelecan attaineth ſometimes the length of two | ſpannes. The bill is made acute or pointed at the end; whereas indeed | itis flatand broad, and ſomewhat inverted at the extreame. It is di-

For firſt , as Pierius obſerveth from Barcephas , the afſumption of humane ſhape, had proved a diſadvantage unto Sathan ; affording not only a ſuſpicious amazement in Eve, beforethe fat, in beholding a third humanity befide her ſelf and Adam, butleaving ſome excuſe un- | to the woman, which afterward the man tooke up with lefler reaſon, that is, to have been deceived by another like her {elfe.
_ , there was no inconvenience inthe ſhape aſſumed, or any conſiderable impediment that might diſturbe that performance in the | common forme of a Serpent : forwhereas itis conceived the woman muſt needs be afraid thereof, and rather fiye then approach it, it was not 2precable unto the condition of Paradiſe and ſtate of innocencie there- in; if inthat place as moſt determine, no creature was hurrfull or ter- rible unto man, and thoſe deſtruRive effeRs they now diſcover ſuccee- ded the curſe , and came in with them is chiefe of thornes and briars, and therefore Eugubinus ( who affirmeth this Serpent was a Bafiliske) incurreth no abſurdity , nor need we inferre that Eve ſhould bee de- ſtroyed immediatly upon that Viſion z for noxious animalls could — _— art. cang bw wes ks AS. | th ea ived their names, ſo cd thei Jaxares : —_— their conditions pron _ each other, they were not ſo unto man, whoſe conſtitutions were antidotes and needed not feare poyſons, who had not incurred mortality.

Cnay. V. Of the Pillure of Adam and Eve with Navells,
A Nother miſtake there may be in the piRure of our firſt Parents, who after the manner of their poſterity are both delineated with a Navel! : and this is obſervable not only in ordinary and ſtayned pee- ces, but inthe Authenticke draughts of Urbin, Angelo, and others; which notwithſtanding cannot be allowed, except we impute that unto the firſt cauſe , which we impoſe not on the ſecond , or what we deny unto nature, we impute unto Naturity it ſelfe ; that is, that inthe firſt and moſt accompliſhed peece, the Creator affeRed ſuperfAlnities,or or- dained parts withoutall uſe or office.
For the uſe of the Navell is to continue the infant unto the Mother, and by the veſſclls thereof to convey its aliment and ſuſtentation : the veſſells whereof it confiſteth, are the umbilicall veyne , which is a branch of the Porta, and implanted in the liver of the Infant ; two Ar- | teries likewiſc ariſing from the Iliacall branches , by which the Infant | receiveth the purer portion of bloud and ſpirits from the mother z and ' laſtly, the Urachos or ligamentall paſſage derived from the bottome | of the bladder , whereby it diſchargeth the wateriſh and urinary of its aliment : now upon the birth when the Infant forſaketh the wombe although it dilacerate , and breakethe involving membranes, yet doe theſe veſſclls hold , and by the mediation thereof the Infant is conneRed unto the wombe not only before , but a while alſo after the birth : theſe therefore the midwife cutteth off, contriving them into a knot cloſe unto the body of the Infant, from whence enſuecth that tor-

forit we conceive the way of his formation , or ot che firſt animalls did carry in all points a ſtriQ conformity unto ſucceeding produRions, we might fall into imaginations that Adam was made without teeth, or that hee ran through choſe notable alterations in the veſlclls of the heart, which the Infant ſuffereth after birth : we need not diſpute whe- ther the cgge or bird were firſt , and might conceive that dogges were created blind, becauſe we obſerve they are littered ſo with us; whichto affirm, is to confound, at leaſt to regulate creation unto generation, the fi: as of God,unto the ſecond of Nature, which were determined in that generall indulgence, Encreaſe and multiply,produce or propagate each other; that is, not anſwerably inall points, but in a prolonged me. | thod according to ſeminall progreſſion: for the formation of things at firſt was different fromtheir generation after 5 and although it had no ching to precede, it was aptlycontrived for that which ſhould ſucceed it: and theretore though Adam were framed without this part, as having no other wombe then that of his proper principles, yet was not his po- ſtericy without the ſame : forthe ſeminalty of his tabricke contained the power thereof, and was endued with the ſcience of thoſe parts whoſe predeſtinations upon ſucceſſion it did accompliſh,
All the Navell therefore and conjunRive part we can ſuppoſe in Adam , was his dependency on his Maker, and the connexion he muſt needs have unto heaven, who was the Son of God, for holding no de- pendence on any preceding efficient but God , inthe aR of his produ- Rion there may bee conceived ſome connexion , and Adam to have | been in a momentall Navell with his Maker : and although from his carnallity and corporall exiſtence the conjunRion ſeemeth no nearer then of cauſality and cffteR, yet in his immortall and diviner part hee ſcemed to hold a nearer coherence, and an umbilicality even with God himſelfe : and ſo indeed although the propriety of this part bee | found but in ſome animalls, and many ſpecies there are which have no navell at all; yet is there one linke and common connexion, one gene- rall ligament, and neceſſary obligation of all whatever unto God; whereby although they a themſclves at diſtance, and ſeem to beat looſe, yet doe they hold a continuity with their Maker, which catena- tion or conſerving union when ever his pleaſure ſhall divide, let goe,or ſeparate, they ſhall fall from their exiſtence, eflence, and operations; in briefe, they muſt retire unto their primitive nothing, and ſhrinke in- to their Chaos againe,

the middeſt of the twelve, many make great doubt, and though they concede a table jeſture will hardly allow this uſuall way of Seſſion. Wherein reſtrayning no mans enquiry , it will appeare that accuba-
tion, or lying downe at meales was a geſture uſed by very many nati- ons. That the Parthians uſed it, is evident from Athenzus, who deli- yereth out of Poſſidonius, that their King lay downe at meales , onan higher bed then others. That Cleopatra thus entertained Anthonie, the ſame Author manifeſteth when he ſaith, ſhee prepared twelve Tri- cliniums. That it was in uſe among the Greeks, the word Triclinium implyeth , and the ſame is alſo declareable from many places inthe Sympoſiacks of Plutarke. That it was not out of faſhion inthe dayes of Ariſtotle, hee declareth in his Politicks, when among the Inſtituti- onary rules of youth, he adviſcth they might not be permitted to heare Iambicks and Tragedies before they were admitted unto diſcumben- cy or lying along with others at their meales. That the Romanes uſed this geſture at repaſt, beſide many more is evident from Lipſius, Mer- curialis, Salmaſius , and Ciaconius who have cxpreſly and diſtine- ly treated hereof.
Now of their accumbing places, the one was called Stibadion and Sigma, carryipg the figure of an halfe Moone, and of an uncertaine ca- pacity, whercafter it received the name of Hexaclinon, ORoclinon, according unto that of Martial,
Accipe Lunata ſcriptum tefludine Sigma Otto capit, veniat quiſquis amicus erit. Here at the left
wing was the principall place, and the moſt honourable perſoo, if hee
were not maſter of the feaſt poſſeſſed that roome. The other was
tearmed Triclinium, that is, Three beds encompaſſing a table,as may ! be ſeen inthe figures thereof, and particularly in the Rhamnufian Tri-
clinium,ſfet down by Mercurialis. The cuſtomary uſe hereof was pro-
bably deduced from the frequent uſe of bathing, after which they
commonly retired to bed, and refeRed themſelves with repaſt;and ſo
that cuſtome by degrees changed their cubiculary beds into diſcubito-
ry,and introduced a faſhion to goe from the bathes unto theſe.
As for their geſture or poſition, the men lay downe leaning on their left elbow , their backe being advanced by ſome pillow or ſoft ſub- ſtance; the ſecond lay ſo with his backe towards the firſt, that his head attained about his boſome;and the reſt in the ſame order : For women,
they ſat ſometimes diſtinRly with their ſexe, ſometime promiſcuouſly with men, according to affeQion or favour, as is delivered by Juyenal | —— Gremio jacuit nova nupts mariti —— and by Suetonius of C- |

by Plutark in his life, that lying on his backe, and rayſing himſelfe up,
being maſter of the feaſt, and lying next unto him, and thus alſo from this Tricliniarie diſpoſure, we may illuſtrate that obſcure expreſſion of Seneca z That the Northwinde was in the middle, the North-Eaſt on the higher ſide,and the Nonth-Weſt onthe lower ; for as appeareth in the circle of the windes, the North-Eaſt will anſwer the bed of Anto- nius;and the North-Weſt that of Perpenna.
That the cuſtome of teaſting upon beds was in uſe among the He-
\ brewes , many diduce fromthe 23. of Ezekicl. Thou fatteſt upon a
ſtately bed,and a table prepared before it. The cuſtome of Diſcalcea- tion or putting off cheir ſhoes at meales, is conceived by ſome to con- firme the ſame; as by that meanes keeping their beds clezne,and there- fore they had a peculiar charge to cate the Paſſcover with their ſhooes on, which InjunRion were needleſſe, it they uſed not to pur them off.
That this diſcumbency at meales was in uſe inthe dayes of our Sa- vioux is conceived propable from ſeverall ſpeeches of his expreſſed in that phraſe,cven unto common Auditors, as Luke the 14. Cum Invite- tus futris ad nuptias non diſcumbas in primo loco,and beſides many more, Matthew the 23. when reprehending the Scribes and Phariſces, hee faith , Amvant protecliſias id eſt primos recubitus in cents, & Protecathe- drias ſroe primas cathedr as in Synagogi: wherein the tearms are very di- ſtinR,and by an Antitheſ1s do plainly diſtinguiſh the poſture of ficting, from this of lying on beds.
That they uſed this geſture at the Paſſcover,is more then probable from the teſtimony of Iewiſh writers,and particularly of Ben-maimon recorded by Scaliger de emendutione temporam : After the ſecond cup according to the Inſtitution, Exod. t 2.

That this geſture was uſed when our Saviour eaxte the Paſſeover, is not conceived improbable from the words whereby the Evangeliſts cxpreſle the ſame, that is, eararinliuy, arach Iu, xalara mw, "AptxAnibiraiy which termes do properly f1gnife this geſture in Ariſtotle, Atherzus,

That ſhe ſtood at Chriſts feet behinde | him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with teares, and did wipe them with the haires of her head 5 which a@ions, it our Saviour ſate, ſhe could not performe ſtanding , and had rather Rood behinde his back, then at his feet 5 and thus it cannot be reconciled what is obſer- vable in many pieces, and even of Raphaell Urbin, wherein Mary Magdalen is piRured before our Saviour , waſhing his feet on her knees, which will not conſiſt with the ſtri& deſcription and letter of the Text,
Now whereas this pofition may ſeeme to be diſcountenanced by our Tranſlation, which uſually renders it ficting , it cannothavethatil- lation; forthe French and Italian cranſlations expreſſing neither po- ſition of ſeſſion or recubation, do onely ſay that he placed himfelte at the table, and when ours expreſſcth the ſame by fitting, it is inrelation unto our cuſtome, time, and apprehenſion ; and the like upon occafion is not unuſuall in our tranſlation, ſo when it is ſaid Luke 4. *i*$=s 73 C:Cxior, and the Vulgar renders it, Cum plicaſſet librum, ours rranſlateth if, he ſhut or cloſed the booke, which 15 an exprefſion proper unto the paginall books of our times, but not ſo agreeable unto volumes or rol ling bookes in uſe among the Jews, not onely inclder times , but even unto this day.

Cuaye. VIII. Of the piltare of «Abraham ſacrificing Iſaac.
[ N the piQure of the Immolation of Iſaac, or Abraham ſacrificing his ſon, Iſaac is deſcribed as a little boy, which notwithſtanding is not conſentaneous unto the authority of Expoſitors, or the circumſtance of the Text ; for therein it is delivered that Iſaac carried on his back the wood for the ſacrifice, which being an holocauſt or burnt offering to be conſumed unto aſhes, we cannot well conceive the wood a burthen for a boy, but ſuch a one unto Iaac, as that which it typified was unto Chriſt, that is, the wood or croſſe whereon he ſuffered, which was too heavy a loade for his ſhoulders, and was faine to be relieved there by Simon of Cyrene. |
Againe, he was ſo farre from a boy, that he was a man growne, and at his full ature, if we beleeve Joſephus, who placeth him in the laſt of Adoleſcency, and makes him twenty five yearcs old ; and whereas in the vulgarTranſlation he is termed puer,ic muſt not be ſtrictly appre- hended, (tor that age properly endeth in puberty , and cxtendeth but unto fourteen) but reſpeRively unto Abraham , who was at that time above ſix{core : And therefore alſo hereinhe was not unlike unto him who was after led dumbe unto the ſlaughter , and commanded by o- thers, who had legions at command, that is in meeknefle and humble ſubmiſhon;for had he refiſted,ir had not been in the power of his aged parent to have inforced; and many at his yeares, have performed ſuch as, as few beſidesatary : David was too ſtrong for a Lion and a Beare, Pompey had deſerved the name of Great , Alexander of the ſame cognomination was Generalifſimo of Greece, and Anniball but one yeare after ſucceeded Aſdruball in that memorable Warre againſt | the Romancs.

And {urely the expoſition of one Text is beſt performed by another , men vainly interpoſing their conſtrutions, where the Scripture deciderh the controverſic z and therefore ſome have ſeemed too aRive in their expoſitions , who in the ſtory of Rahabthe harlot , have given notice that the word alſo {ignifieth an Hoſteſſe, - for inthe Epiſtle tothe He- brewes, ſhe is plainly tearmed =p", which fignifies not an Hoſteſle; but a pecuniary and proſtituting Harlot, a tearme applyed unto Lais by the Greeks, and diſtinguiſhed from *=%#, or «mics, 25 may appeare in the thirteenth of Atherzus.
And therefore more allowable is the T ranſlation of Tremellius, then that ofthe Vulgar, 2aod ſplendida fattaefſet cubes facies ejus, Ot rather as Eſtius hath interpreted it, facies ejus erat radoſa, his tace was radiant, and diſperſing beames like many hornes and cones about his | head; which is alſo conſonant unto the original {ignification,and yetob- ſcrved inthe peeces of our Saviour, and the Virgin Mary, who are com- monly drawne with ſcintillations, or radiant Halo's about their head; which after the French expreſſion are uſually tearmed, the Glory.

So Rubenis conceived to bear three Barres wave, Judah a Lion Rampant, Dan a Serpent nowed, Simeon a Sword inpale the point erected, &c. the ground whereof is the laſt BenediRion of Jacob, wherein he reſpeRively draweth com. pariſons from things here repreſented.
Now herein although we allow a copſiderable meaſure of truth, yet whether as they are uſually deſcribed, theſe were the proper cognizan- ces, and coat armes of the Tribes, whether in this manner applyed,and uponthe grounds preſumed, materiall doubts remaine.
For firſt, they are not ſtrictly made out, from the Propheticall bleſ- fing of Jacobzfor Simeon and Levi have diſtin coats,that is a Sword, and the two tables , yet are they by Jacob included in one Prophefie, Simeon and Levi are brethren, Inſtruments of cruelties are in their ha- birations. So Joſeph beareth an Oxe, whereof notwithſtanding there is no mention in this Propheſie; for therein it is ſaid Joſeph is atruitfull bough, even a fruicfull bough by a well ; by which repetition are inti- | mated the two Tribes deſcending from him Ephraim and Manaſſes, whereof notwithſtanding Ephraim beareth an Oxe : True it is, that

dreame of Pharaoh,which he interpreted, the benefit by Agriculture, and provident proviſion of corne which he performed , and therefore did Serapis bearca buſhell upon his head.
Againe, if we take theſe two benediRions together, the reſemblan. ces are not appropriate, and Moſes therein conformes not unto Jacob; forthat which in the Propheſic of Jacob is appropriated umo one,is in the bleſſing of Moſes made common unto others : So whereas Judah | is compared untoa Lion by Jacob, Judah is a Lions whelpe; the ſame is applyed unto Dan by Moſes, Dan is a Lions whelpe, he ſhall leape from Baſhan : and alſo unto Gad, he dwelleth as a Lion, and teareth | the arme with the Crowne of the head.
Thirdly, if a Lyon were the proper coat of Judah , yet were it not probably a Lyon Rampant, as it is commonly deſcribed , bur rather couchant or dormant, as ſome Heralds and Rabins doe determine, ac- cording to the letter of the Text, Recumbens 4ormiſti at Leo , He cou- ched asa Lyon, and asa young Lyon, who ſhall rouſe him *

ciple or Legionary ſtandards, that is of Judah, Ruben, Ephraim, and
them very variouſly, Jonathan who compiled the Thargum,conceives
plate, and upon which the names of the Tribes were engraven. Sothe ſtandard for the campe of Judah, was of three colours according unto the ſtones, Chalcedony, Saphir, and Sardonix ; and therein were cx- preſſed the names of the three tribes, Judah, Ifachar,and Zabulon,and inthe middeſt thereof was witten, Riſe up Lord,and let thy enemies be ſcattered, and let them that hate thee flye before thee; in it was alſo the pouttrait of a Lyon: The ſtandard of Ruben was alſo of three colours, Sardine, Topaz, and Amethyſt , therein were exprefſed the names of Ruben, Simeon, and Gad, inthe middeſt was written, Heare,O Iſrael, the Lord our God, the Lord is one: Therein was alſo the pourtraiture of a Hart. But Abenezra and others befide the colours of the field, do ſet downeother charges , in Rubens the forme of a man or mandrake, in thatof Judah a Lyon, in Ephraims an Oxe, in Dan's the figure of an Xgle.
AG thus indeed the foure figures in the banners of the principall ſquadrons of Iſracl are anſwerable unto the Cherubins in the viſion of
neſſe of their faces, they foure hadthe likeneſle ofthe face of a Man, they foure had alſo the face of an Zgle, andthe face of a Lyon onthe right fide, and they foure had the tace of an Oxe on the left fide, they foure had alſo the face of an Agle ; and conformable hereunto the pi- ures of the Evangeliſts ( whoſe Goſpells are the Chriſtian banners) are ſet forth with the addition of a Man or Angell,an Oxe, a Lyon, and an Zgle ; and theſe ſymbolically repreſent the office of Angells, and Miniſters of Gods will ; in whom is required underſtanding as in a Man, courage and vivacity as in the Lyon, ſervice and miniſteriall _— as in the Oxe, expedition or celerity of execution, as in the Zgle. |
rk hence therefore we may obſerve that theſe deſcriptions the moſt authenticke of any, are neither agreeable unto one another, nor unto the Scuchions in queſtion; for though they agree in Ephraim and Judah, that is the Oxe and the Lyon , yet doe they differ inthoſe of Dan, and Ruben, as farre as an Mgle is different from a Serpent , and the figure of a Man,Hart,or Mandrake, from three Barres wave, where- innotwithſtanding we rather declare the incettainty of Armes in this particular,then any way queſtion their antiquity; for hereof more anci-
ent examples there are, then the Scucheons of the Tribes , if Olyris,

Cuay. XII. Of the Pifture deſcribing the death of Cleopatra.
He Picture concerning the death of Cleopatra with two Aſpes or venemous Serpents unto her armes, or breaſts , or both , requires | conſideration : for therein ( befide that this variety is not excuſable) the thing it ſelfe is queſtionable ; nor is it indiſputably certaine what manner of death ſhe dyed. Plutarch in the life of Antonie plainly de- livereth;rhat no man knew the manner of her death; for ſome affirmed ſhe periſhed by poyſon, which ſhe alwayes carried inalittle hollow —_ , and wore it in her hayre 5 befidethere were never any Aſpes diſcovered in the place of her death , although two of her maids peri- ſhed alſo with her, only it was ſaid two ſmall and almoſt inſenfible prickes were found upon her arme; which was all the ground that Czſar had to preſume the manner of her death. Galen who was con- temporary unto Plutarch, delivereth two wayes of herdeath : that is, that ſhee killed her ſclfe by the bite of an Aſpe, or bit an hole in her arme, and powred poyſon therein. Strabo that lived before them both, hath alſo two opinions, that ſhe dyed by the byte of an Aſpe, or elſe a poyſonous oyntment.
We might queſtion the length of the Aſpes which are ſometimes deſcribed exceeding ſhort , whereas the Cherſza or land Aſpe which moſt conceive ſhe uſed, is above foure cubits long : their number is not unqueſtionable z for whereas there are generally rwo deſcribed, Auguſtus (as Plutarch relateth) did carry in his triumphthe Image of Coons but with one Aſpe nnto her arme : as for the two pricks,'or little ſpots in her arme,they rather infer the fex, then plurality : for like the viper, the female Aſpe hath foure, but the male two teeth, where- by it left this impreſſion, or double punRure behinde it.
And laſtly, we might queſtionthe place, for ſome apply them unto |
r breaſt , which notwithſtanding will not confiſt with the hiſtory,
d Petrus Vicorius hath well obſerved the ſame : but herein the mi- ſtake was cafie, it being the cuſtome in capicall malefaRors to apply them unto the breaſt , as the Author De Theriaca ad Piſonem, an eyc- witneſſe hereof in Alexagdria, where Cleopatra dyed , determineth; | beheld faith he, in Alexandria, how ſuddenly theſe Serpents bereave | Ii 2 a man

Cud*% AL Of the Piltures of the nine Worthies,
Ti picures of the nine Worthies are not unqueſtionable, and to criticall ſpeAators may ſeeme to containe ſundry improprieties: Some will enquire why Alexander the Great is deſcribed upon an Ele-
+ phant? for indeed, we donot finde he uſed that animall in his Armies,
| much lefle in his owne perſon, but his horſe is famous in hiſtory, and | its name alive to this day : Beſide, he fought but one remarkable battaile, wherein there were any Elephants, and that was with Porus King of India, In which notwithſtanding, as Curtius, Arrianns, and ' Plutarch report , he was on horſeback himſclfe 5 and if becauſe hee fought againſt Elephants , he is with propriety ſet upon their backs, with no lefſe or greater reaſon is the ſame deſcription agreeable unto Judas Maccabcus, as may beobſerved from the hiſtory of the Maccs- bees 3 and alſo unto Julius Czſar, whoſe triumph was honoured with captive Elephants, as may be obſerved inthe order thereof , ſet forth by Jacobus Laarms : and it alſo wee ſhould admitthis deſcription upon 21 Elephant, yet were not the manner thereof unqueſtionable, tharis, in his 1uling the beaſt alone for, beſide the champion upon their back, there was alſo a guide or Ruler, which ſate more forward to command or guide the beaſt : Thus did King Porus ride when hee was over- throwne by Alexander , and thus are alſo the towred Elephants deſcri- bed, Maccab.2.6. Ulponthe beaſts there were ſtrong towres of wood which covered every one of them, and were girt faſt umo them by de- vices ; there were alſo upon every oneof them thirty rwo ſtrong men, beſide the Indian that ruled them.
Others will demand, not onely ——_—_— upon af! Elephart, but HeRor upon an Horſe 2 whereas His manner of fighting , or pre- ſenting himſelte in battaile, was ina Chariot , 2s did the other noble Trojans, who as Pliny affirmeth were the firſt inventers thereof, the | ſame way of fight is teſtified by Diodorus , and thus delivered by Sir

and made it one argument of their originall from Troy. Laſtly, by any man verſed in Antiquity, the queſtion can hardly be avoyded, why the horſes of theſe Worthies, eſpecially of Czfar, are deſcribed with the furniture of ſadles, and ſtyrropsz for ſadles largely taken, though ſome deferice there may be, yetthat they had not the uſe of ſtirrops, ſeemeth our of doubr, as Pancirollus hath ob- ſerved, as Polydore Virgil and Petrus Victorius have confirmed, ex- preſly diſcourfing hereon ; as is obſervable from Pliny , and catinot eſcape our eyes in the ancient monuments, medals and Triumphantar- chesof the Romanes.

e hand of the Painter confidently fetteth forth the piure of Jcphthah inthe poſture of Abraham, ſacrificing his onely daugh- ter; Thus indeed is it commonly received, and hath had the atteſt of many worthy Writers ; notwithſtanding upon ity wee finde the matter doubtfull, and many upon probable grounds to have beene of
kinde of death, and a feperation anely untothe Lord , for that he pur- ſued not his yow untoa literall oblation , there want not arguments both from the Text and reaſon.
- For firſt, it is evident that ſhe deplored her virginity , and not her
death; Let megoe up and dowric the mountaines , and bewayle my virginity, I and my fellowes. Secondly, when it is ſaid,that Jephthah did unto her according unto | his yow, it is immediately ſubjoyned, E# non cognovit viram, and ſhee knew no man, which as immediate in words, was probably moſt neere in ſence unto the vow.
Thirdly, it is ſaid in the Text , that the daughters of 1ſracl went yearely to talke with the daughter of Jephthah foure dayes in the yeare, which had ſhe beene ſacrificed, they could not have done ; For whereas the word is ſometime tranſlated to lament, yet doth it alſo ſignifie to talke or have conference with one, and by Tremellius who was well able to judge of the Originall, it is in this ſence tranſlated : Iban filii Iſraelitaram ad confabulandum cum filia Tephthaci quatuor die- bus quotannis : And (o it is alfo ſet downe in the marginall notes of our Tranſlation: And from this annuall concourſe of the daughters of Ifrael, it isnot improbable io future Ages, the daughter of J-phthah came to be worſhipped as a Deity, and had by the Samaritans an annu- all feſtivity obſerved unto her honour, as Epiphanius hath lefe recor- ded inthe herefie of the Melchidecians.
It is alſo repugnant unto reaſon , for the offering of mankinde was

2painſt the Law of God, who ſo abhorred humane facrifice,that he ad- mitted not the oblation of uncleane beaſts, and confined his altars bur unto five kinds of Animals, that is, the Oxe, the Goat, the Sheepe, the | Pigeon and its kinds: in the cleanſing of the leper,there is I confeſle, | mention made of the Sparrow, but _ diſpute may be made whether it be properly readred , and therefore the Scripture with indignati oft times makes mention of humane ſacrifice among the les, whoſe oblations ſcarce made ſcruple of any Animall , ſacrificing not onely man, but Horſes, Lyons, Egles;and though they come not into holocauſts, yet do we read the Syrians did makeoblations of fiſhes un- rothe goddeſle Derceto Ic being therefore a ſacrifice ſo abominable
and wiſedem of Iſrael would have permitted it, and that not onelyin
regard of the ſubje& or ſacrifice it ſelfe, but alſo the ſacrificator,which
the piture makes to be Jepthah, who was neither Prieſt , nor capable |
of that office; for he was a Gileadite, and as the text affirmeth, the ſon
alſo of an harlot ; And how hardly the Prieſthood would endure en- |
—_— upon their funRion, a notable example there is in the Sto- of Ozias.
Secondly, the offering up of his daughter was not onely unlawfull,
and entrenched upon his religion, but had beene a courſe and progprefle that had much condemned his diſcretion, that is,to have puniſhed him- | lelfe in the ſtricteſt obſervance of his Vow, when as the L1w of God | had allowed an evaſion; that is, by way of commutation or redempti- cn,according as is determined, Levi.27. whereby if ſhe were between the age of five and twenty,ſhec was to be eſtimated but at ten ſhekels, and if between twenty and ſixty,not above thirty;a ſum that could ne- ver diſcourage an indulgent Parent , it being but the value of a ſervant lain, and the inconſiderable Salarie of Judas, and will make no grea- ter noiſe then three pound fifteen ſhillings with us; and therefore their conceit is not to be exploded, who ſay that from the Story of Jepthah ſacrificing his owne daughter, might ſpring the fable of Agamemnon, delivering unto ſacrifice his daughter Iphigenia,who was alſo contem- porary unto Jepthah , wherein to anſwere the ground that hinted it, Iphigenia was not ſacrificed her ſclf,but redeemed with an Hart, which Diana accepted for her. Now the ground at lezſt which much promoted the opinion,might be the dubious words of the text,which containe the ſenſe of his vow; moſt men —_— unto their common and obvious acception. What- ſoever ſhall come forth of the doores of my houſe ſhall ſurely be the Lords, and I will offer it up for a burntoffering, Now whereas it is ſaid, Evit Iehove. & offeram illud holocaufturs , The word ſignifying both & and «s#, it may be taken disjunRively , aut offerazs , th is, It ſhall either be the Lords by ſeparation, orclſe, an holocauſt by com- mon

He picture of St Chriſtopher,that is a man of a Giant like ſtature, bearing upon his ſhoulders our Saviour Chriſt, and with a ſt:ffe in his hand, wading thorow the water, is known unto children, common over all Europe, not onely as a figne unto houſes , bur is deſcribed in many Churches , and ſtands Coloſſus like in the entrance of Noſtre Dame in Parks.
Now from hence, common eyes conceive an hiſtory ſutable unto this deſcription, that he carried our Saviour in his Minority over ſo:ne river or water, which notwithſtanding wee cannot at all make out ; for weeread not thus much in any good Author , nor of any remarkable Chriſtopher, before the reigne of Decius, who lived 250. yeares after Chriſt, this man indeed according unto Hiſtory ſuffered as a Martyr in the ſecond yeare df that Emperour , and inthe Roman Calender takes upthe 21. of + of

Cuayr., XVII. Of the Pilinre of $. George.
F He Piure of St. George killing the Dragon, and, as moſt ancient draughts doe run, with the daughter of a King ſtanding by, is fa- mous amongſt Chriſtians ; and upon this deſcription dependeth a ſo- lemne ſtory , how by this atchieveme he redeemed a Kings daughter, which is more eſpecially beleeved by the Engliſh , whole ProteRor he is, and in which forme and hiſtory , according to his deſcription io the Engliſh Colledge at Rome, he is ſet forthin the Icons or Cuts of Martyrs by Cevallerius. Now of what authority ſoever this piece be among us,it is I perceive received with different belieftes : for ſome men belceve the perſon and the ſtory , ſomethe perſon , but not the ſtory, and others deny both.
That ſuch a perſon there was, we ſhall not contend : the indifſtin&i- on of many in the community of name, or the application of the a of one unto another, have made ſome doubt there was no ſuch manat all, | For of this name we meet with more then one in hiſtory , and no leſle then two of Cappadocia,the one an Arrian, who was ſlain by the Alex- andriansinthe time of Julian, the other a valiant Souldier and Chriſti- an Martyr , beheaded inthe reigne of Diocleſian : And this is the George conceived inthis piure , who hath his day in the Romane Calender, on whom ſo many fables are delivered , whoſe ſtory is ſet torth by Metaphraſtes, and his myracles by Turonenftis.
As tor the ſtory depending hereon , we cannot make out the yerity thereof, and conceive the literall acceptiona mcere miſtake of the ſym- bolicall exppeſſion,; apprehending that a veritable hiſtory, which was | but an emblem or peece of Ctuiſſian poſie.

Crar. XVIII. Of the Pilture of Jerome.
He PiRure of Jerome uſually deſcribed at his ſtudy, with a Clock hanging by him is not to be omitred; for thoughthe meaning bee allowable, and probable it is that induſtrious Father did not let flip his time without account, yet muſt not perhaps that Clocke be ſet downe to have been his meaſure thereof : For Clocks are Automatous organs, and \uch whereby we now diſtinguiſh of time, have found no menti- on in ary ancient Writers, but are of late invention, as Pancirollus ob- ſerveth, and Polydore Virgil diſcourſing of new inventions whereof the authors are not knowne makes inſtance in Clocks and Guns : now Jerome is no late Writer, but one of the ancient Fathers, and lived in the fourth Century, inthe reigne of Theodofius the firſt. It is not to be denyed that before the dayes of Jerome there were Horologies, and ſeverall accounts of time , for they meaſured the hours not only by drops of water in glaſſes called Clepſydrz, but atfo by ſand in glafſes called Clepſammia; there werealſo from great anti- quity, Sciotericall or Sun Dialls, by the ſhadow of a ſtile or gnomon denoting the houres of the day : an invention aſcribed unto Anaxime- nes by Pliny ; hereof a yery memorable one there was in Campus Martius from an obelisk erected, 8& golden figures placed horizontally about it, which was brought out of Agyptby Auguſtus,and deſcribed

lous birds,according to the deſcription of Ovid,and the account there-
of in Hyginus, that they were the daughters of Melpomene, and meta.
morphoſicd into the ſhape of man and bird by Ceres.
And therefore theſe pieces ſo common among us, do rather derive their originall, or arc indeed the very deſcriptions of Dagon, which was made with humane figure above, and fiſhy ſhape below , whoſe ſtumpe, or as Tremellius and our margin renders it , whoſe fiſhie part onely remained, when the hands and upper part fell before the Arke. Of the ſhape of Atergates, or Derceto with the Phzniceans ; in whoſe fiſhie and feminine mixture,as ſome conceive,were implyed the Moon and the Sca, or the Deity of the waters z and therefore, in their ſacrifi- ces they made oblations of fiſhes : from whence were probably occa- fioned the pictures of Nereides and Tritons among the Grecians, and ſuch as we reade in Macrobius, to have beene placed on the top of the temple of Saturne.

As for the Ulnicorne, if it have the head of a Deere, and the tayle of a Boare, as Vartomannus deſcribeth it, how agreeable it is in this pi- | ure every eye may diſcerne: if it be made biſulcousor cloyenfoor- ed, it agreeth unto the deſcription of Vartomannus, but ſcarce of any | other ; and Ariſtotle ſuppoſeth that ſuch as devide the hoofe doe double the horne ; they being both of the ſame nature, and admitting diviſion together.

for, they afſiumed the ſhipes of animals common unto all eyes, and by their conjunRions and compoſitions were able to communicate their conceptions unto #ny that coapprehended the Syntaxis of their natures. | This doe many conceive to have beene the primitive way of wiiting, and of greater Antiquity then letters; and this indeed might Adain well have ſpoken, who underſtanding the nature of things, had the ad- vantage of naturall expreſſions, which the Agyprians bur taking
truſt upon their owne or common opinion, trom conceded tniſtakes they authentically promoted errors, deſcribing in their Hieroglyphicks creatures of their owne invention; or from knowne and conceded ani- mals, erecting ſignitications not inferrible from their natures.
'And firſt , alchough there were more things in Nature then words which did exprefſethem, yet even in theſe mute and ilent diſcoutſes, toexpreſle complexed fignifications, they took a liberty to compoand and piece together creatures of allowable formes unto mixtures inex- ſtent and thus beganthe deſcriptions of Griphins, Bafilisks, Pheznfx, | and many more z which Emblematiſts and Heralds have entertained with fignifications anſwering their inſtitutions; Hieroglyphically ad- | ding Martegres, Wivernes, Lion- fiſhes, with divers others ; picces of good and allowable invention unto the prudent SpeRator , but are lookt on by vulgar eyes as literall truths, or abſurd impofſibilities ; whereas , indeed they are commendable inventions , and of laudable | ſignifications. | |
Againe, beſide theſe pieces fiftitiouſly ſet downe, and having no copy in Nature, they had many unqueſtionably drawne of inconſe- quent ſignification, nor naturally verifying their intention.

And therefore the Embleme of Superſtition was well ſet out by Ripa, in the picture of an Owle , an Hare, and anold woman; and it | no way confirmeth the Auguriall conſideration, that an Owle is a for- | bidden food inthe Law of Moſes; or that Jeruſalem was threatned by the Raven and the Owle, in that expreſſion of Elay 34, That it ſhould be a court for Owles, that the Cormorant and the Burtcrne ſhould poſ- ſefle it, and the Owle and the Raven dwell init; for thereby was only implyed their enſuing deſolation , as is expounded inthe words ſuc- | —_— ſhall draw upon it the line of contuſion, and the ſtones of emprineſle.

Thus Achilles though dipped in Styx, yet having his heele untouched by that water, although he were fortified elſewhere, he was {laine in that part , and as only vulnerable in the inferiour and brutall part of Man : This is that part of Eve and her poſterity the divel ſtill doth bruiſe;thar is,that part of the ſoul which adhereth untoearth, and walks inthe paths thereof z and in this ſecondary and ſymbolicall ſenſc it may be allo underſtood , when the Prieſts in the Law waſhed their feet before the ſacrifice z when our Saviour waſhed the feet of his Diſciples, and ſaid unto Peter , it I waſh not thy feet thou haſt no part in me; and thus is it ſymbollically explainable and implieth purifi- cationand cleanneſle , when inthe burnt offerings the Prieſt is com»
manded to waſh the inwards and legs thereof in water,and in the peace
and (in-offerings, to burne the two kidneys , the fat which is about the

the Jewes when they bleſled themſelves, had any cye unto the words

Surely thoſe heathens, that nofvithſtanding their exemplary advantage in heaven, would endure no piftures of Sun or Moone, as being viſible unto all the world, and needing no repre- ſentation, do evidently accuſe the pratiſe of thoſe pencils , that will deſcribe invifibles. And he that challenged the boldeſt hand unto the picture of an Echo, muſt laugh at this attempt not onely in the deſcri- ption of inviſibility, but circumſcription of Ulbiquity , and fetchirg under lines incomprehenſible circularity. | The pictures of the Agyptians were more tolerable, and in their {a- cred letters more veniably expreſſed the apprehenſion of Divinity ; for though they implycd the ſame by anecye upon a Scepter , by an Eagles head, a Crocodill and the like z yet did theſe manual! defcri- ptions pretend no corporall repreſentatians, nor could the people mil- conceive the ſame unto reall correſpondencies, So though the Cherub carryed ſome apprehenſion of Divinity, yet was it not conceived to be the ſhape thercof : and ſo perhaps becauſe it is metaphorically _ cate

And ſurely that religion which excuſcth the faR of Noah, in the aged ſut- prifall of fix hundred yeares, and unexpected inebriation from the un- knowne cffcQs of wine, will neither acquit cbriofity nor cbriety, in| | their knowne and intended perverſions.
And indeed, although ſometimes effects ſucceed which may r&| +| lieve the body, yet if they carry miſchicte or perill unto the ſoule, we are therein reſtraineable by Divinity, which circumſcribeth Phyfick, and circumſtantially determines the uſe thereof. From naturall confi- derations, Phyſick commendeth the uſe of venery; and kappily,inceſt, adultery, or ſtupration may prove as phyſically advantageous, as co0- jugall copulation ; which notwithſtanding muſt not bee drawne into practiſe. And truly effe&s, conſequents , or events which wee com- "a mend, ariſe oft times from wayes which all condemne. Thus from the fat of Lot, we derive the generation of Ruth, and bleſſed Nativity of
our Saviour ; which notwithſtanding did not extenuate the inceſtuous ebriety of the generator. And if, as it is commonly urged, we thioke
to extenuate ebtiety from the benefit of yomit oft ſucceeding ; Agyp- | ian

19. A conceit there is that the Devill commonly appearcth with a cloven hoofe, wherein although it ſeeme exceffively ridiculous there 4 may be ſomewhat of truth; and the ground thereof at firſt might be '| his frequent appearing in the ſhape of a Goat, which anſwers that de- ſcription. This was the opinion of ancient Chriſtians concerning the apparitions of Panites, Faunes and Satyres, and in this forme we reade of one that appeared unto Antony inthe wildernefle. The ſame is alſo confirmed from expoſitions of holy Scripture ; for whereas it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt not offer unto Devils, the Originall word is Seghnirims, that | is, rough and hayrie Goats,becauſe in that ſhipe the Devill moſt ofren | F*v-7- appeared, as is expounded by the Rabbins, as Tremellius hath alſo ex- plained ; and as the word Alcimah, the god of Emath is by ſome con- ceived ; nor did he onely aſſume this ſhape inelder times, but com- monly in later dayes, eſpecially inthe place of his worſhip. Ii there be any truth inthe confeſſion of Witches, and as in many ſtories it ſtands confirmed by Bodinus z and therefore a Goat is not improperly made the Hieroglyphick of the Devill, as Pierius hath expreſled ic ; ſo might it be the Embleme of ftn, as it was in the fin offering ; and ſo likewiſe of wicked and finfull men, according to the expreſſion of Scripture in ' the method of the laſt diſtribution, when our Saviour ſhall ſeparate the | Sheep from the Goats, that is, the ſons of the Lamb from the children of the Devill. 20. Aſtrange kinde of exploration and peculiar way of Rhabdo- mancy is that which is uſed in Minerall diſcoveries, that is, with a forked hazell, commonly called Moſes his rod , which freely held | forth, will ſtirre and play if any mine be under it: and though many | |thereare who have attempted to make it good, yet untill better infor- | | mation, weare of opinion with Agricola, that in it ſelfe itis a fruitleſſe | exploration, ſtrongly ſenting of Pagan derivation, and the wirgals Di- vina, proverbially magnified of old 3; the ground whereof were the | Magicall rods in Poets; that of Pollas in Homer, that of Mercury that charmed Argus, and that of Circe which transformed the followers | | of Ulyfles ; too baldly uſurping the name of Moſes rod , from which notwithſtanding , and that of Aaron were probably occaſioned the | fables of all thereſt ; for that of Moſes muſt needs be famous unto the 1 Apyptians, and that of Aaron unto many other nations, as being pre- _ inthe Arke , untill the deftruRion of the Temple built by $0- Omon.

are ancient fragments of Pagan divination, the firſt an imitation of ſortes Homerice, or Virgiliane, drawing determinations from verſes ca- ſually occurring. The ſame was practiſed by Severus, who entertained ominous hopes of the Empire, from that verſein Virgil, Ts regere im. perto s Romane memento ; and Gordianus who reigned but few dayes was diſcouraged by another, that is , Oſtendunt terris banc tan. tum fata nec altra eſſe ſinumt. Nor was this onely performed in Heathen

As for the Divination or deciſion from the ſtaffe it is an Auguriall relique , and the praRiiſe thereof is-accuſed by God himſelfe z My people aske counſell of their ſocks , and their ſtaffe declareth unto them. And of this kinde of Rhabdomancy was that praiſed by Na- buchadonoſor ia that Caldean miſcellany, delivered by Ezekiel, The King of Babylon ſtood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes to uſe divination, he made his arrowes bright, he conſulted
cations for Jeruſalem, that is, as Eſtius expoundeth it the lefe wayſea-
ding unto Rhabbah the chiefe city of the Ammonites, and the right
unto Jeruſalem, he conſulted Idols and entrals, he threw up a bundle of Arrowes, to ſee which way they would light, and falling on the right hand he marched towards Jeruſalem. A like way of Belomancy or Di- vination by Arrowes hath beene in requeſt with Scy Germans, with the Africans and Turks of Algier z but of another nz- ture was that which was praQtiſed by Eliſha, when by an Arrow ſhot from an Eaſterne window, he preſignified the deftruRion of Syria; or when according unto the three ſtroakes of Joaſh, with an arrow upon the ground , he foretold the number of his victories z for thereby the Spirit of God particular'd the ſame, and determined the ſtroakes of the King unto three , which the hopes of the Prophet expeRed intwice that number.
We arc unwilling tocnlarge concerning many other,onely referring unto Chriſtian conſiderations, what naturall effeRs can reaſonably be expeRed, when to prevent the Ephialtes or night-Mare we hang up an hallow ſtone in our ſtables ; when: for amulets againſt Agues wee uſe the chips of Gallowes and places of Execution.

[the touch of the dead. Swarmes hereof our learned Selden and criti-| call Philologers might illuſtrate, whoſe abler performances our adven- tures doe bur ſollicite,meane while we hope they wil plaufibly reccave our attempts, or candidely corre our milconjeRures,

And firſt, the Heathens or hiſtories of the Gentiles afford us ſlender ſatisfaRion, nor can they relate any ſtory, or affixe a probable point ro its beginning: For ſome thereof(and thoſe of the wiſeſt amongſt them) are ſo far from determining its beginning, that they opinion and main- taine it never had any at all; as the doRrine of Epicurus implyeth, and more poſitively Ariſtotle in his bookes de Celo declareth , endeavou- ring to confirme it with arguments of reaſon , and thoſe appearingly demonſtrative;whertein to ſpeake indifferently,his labours are rationall, and uncontroulable upon the grounds aſſumed, that is of Phyſicall ge-

Others are ſo far from defining the originall of the world or of man- kinde, that they have held opinions not only repugnant unto Chrono-
where they inhabited, aſſuming or receiving appellations conformable unto ſuch conceits : So did the Athenians tearm themſelves 4v15;81«: gr Aborigines, and in teſtimony thereof did wearea golden inſeR ontheir heads; the very ſame name isalſo given unto the Inlanders or Midland inhabitants of this Ifland by Czſar. But this is a conceit anſwerable unto the generation of the Giants, not admitrable in Philoſophy,much leſſe in Divinity , which diſtinRly informeth wee are all the ſeed of Adam, that the whole world periſhed unto cight perſons before the
there was therefore never any Auwtochthon, or man ariſing fromthe earth but Adam, for the woman being formed out of the rib,was once removed from earth, and framed from that element under incarnation, And ſo although her produQtion were not by copulation, yet was it in a manner ſeminall : For if in every part from whence the ſeed doth flow, there be contained the Idea of the whole, there was a ſeminality and contracted Adam in therib, which by che information of a ſoule, was individuated into Eye. And therefore this conceit applycd unto the orginall of man, and the beginning of the world, is more juſtly 3 propriable unto its end; for then indeed menſhall riſc out ofthe e
the graves ſhall ſhoot up their concealed ſeeds, and in that great Autumne men ſhall ſpring up, and awake from their Chaos againe. Others have been ſo blind indeducing the originall of things, or de- livering their owne beginnings , that when it hath fallen into contro- verſie they have not recurred untoChronologie or the records of time, but betaken themſelves unto probabilities , and the corjecuralities of Philoſophy. Thus when the two ancient Nations, that 1s, X2yprians and Scychians contended for antiquity, the Agyptians ( as Diodorus and Juſtine relate ) pleaded their antiquity from the fertility of their ſoyl, inferring that men there firſt inhabited, where they were with moſt facility ſuſtained,and ſuch a land did they conceive was Agypt. The Scythians although a cold and heavier Nation urged more acutely , deducing their arguments from the two aRive elements and principles of all things Fire and Water, for if of all things there was firſt an union, and that afterward fire overruled the reſt, ſurely that part of- earth which was coldeft would fi:ſt get free, and afford a place of ha-

would ſurely firſt appeare, which were moſt high, and of moſt cleva- ted ſituation, and ſuch was theirs : Theſe reaſons carried indeed the antiquity from the Agyptians, but confirmed it not in the Scyrhians, for as Herodotus relateth from Pargitants their firſt King unto Darius, they accounted but two thouſand years.
As for the &gyprtians they invented another way of triall, for as the ſame Author relateth, Pſamnitichus their King attempred this deciſion " | by a new & unknown experiment, bringing uptwo Intants with goats, and where they never heard the voice of man; concluding that to be the ancienteſt Nation, whoſe language they ſhould firſt deliver, but herein | he forgot that ſpeech was by inſtruction not inſtinR, by imitation, not by nature; that men do ſpeak in ſome kind but like Parrers, and.as they arc inſtruQed, that is in ſimple tearms and words, expreffing the open | notions of things , which the ſecond aR of reaſon compoundeth into propoficions,and the Jaſt into ſyllogiſms 8 forms of ratiocination. And howſoever the account of Maneth the Agyptian Prieſt run very high, and it be evident that Mizraim pcopled thatCountry,whoſe name with the Hebrews it beareth unto this day;and there be many things of great antiquity related in holy Scripture, yet was their exaR account not ve1 ancient; for Prolomy their Countryman beginneth his Aſtronomical! compute no higher then Nabonafſer , who is conceived by ſome the lame withSalmanaſſer : As for the argument deduced from the fertility of the ſoyl,duly enquired,it rather overthroweth then promoteth their antiquity;for thatCountry whoſe fertility,they ſo advance, was in elder and ancient times no firme or open land , but ſome'vaſt lake or part of
the Sea, and became a gained ground by the mud and limous matter brought downe by the river Nilus , which ſetled by degrecs into a firme land ;z according as is expreſſed by Strabo, and more at large by Herodotus in his Euterpe , both from the Agyptian tradition and pro- bable inducements from reaſon, called therefore fluvii donum, an ac- ceſſion of the earth or traR of land acquired by the river. ;
Laſtly, ſome indeed there are, who have kept records of time, and that of a conſiderable duration, yet doe the exaReſt thereof afford no fatisfaRion concerning the beginning of the world , or any way point out the time of its creation. The moſt authentick records and beſt ap- proved antiquity are thoſe of the Chaldeans ; yet inthe time of Alex- ander the Great, they attained not ſo high as the floud': For as Simpli- cius relateth, Ariſtotle required of Caliſthenes who accompained that Worthy in his expedition, that at his arrive at Babylon, he would en- | quire of the antiquity of their Records, and thoſe upon compute hee | foundto amount unto 1903. yeares, which account notwithſtanding | ariſeth no higher then 95. yeares after the loud.

{ets downe this account, computing by certaine intervalls, by memo- rable Ara's,Epoche's, ortearms of time: As from the creation unto the floud, from thence unto Abraham, from Abraham unto the departure from Egypt, &c. Now inthis number have only beene Samaritans, Jews, and Chriſtians : for the Jews they agree not in their accounts,as
| Bodine in his method of hiſtory hath obſerved out of Baal Seder,
|
| vable from two moſt learned Jewes, Philo and Joſephus , who very much differ in the accounts of time , and variouſly ſumme up thelcin- |

| they embraced the five bookes of Moſes, and, it ſeemeth, preſerved
Rabbi Naſſom, Gerſom, and others, is whoſe compute the age of the world is not yet 5400. yeares ; andthe {ame is more evidently obſer-
tervalls afſented unto by all. Thus Philo from the departure out of Agypt unto the building of the Temple accounts but 920, yeares, but Jolephus ſets downe 1062. Philo from the building of the Templeto its deſtruRion 440, Joſephus 470 , Philo from the creation to the de-
luge to the deſtruion ot the Temple 1718, but Joſephus 1913 , in which computes there are manifeſt diſparities , and ſuch as muchdi- vide the concordance and harmony of times.
But for the Samaritans , their account is different from theſe or any others; for they account from the Creationto the Deluge , but 1302 yeares, which commeth to paſſe upon the different account of the ages of the Patriarks ſet downe when they begat children. For whereas the Hebrew,Greek and Latine texts account Jared 162 whenhe begat Enoch, they account but 62, and ſo in others. Now the Samaritans were no incompetent judges of times and the Chronologie thereof; for
the Text with far moreintegrity then the Jews z who as Tertullian, Chryſoſtome,and others obſerve did ſeverall wayes corrupt the ſame eſpecially in paſſages concerning the propheſies of Chriſt, ſo that as Jerome profeſſeth , in his tranſlation he was faine ſometime to relieve himſclfe by the Samaritane Pentateuch , as amongſt others in that Text, Deuteronomy 27, Maledifiws omns qui non permanſerit in omnl- bus qua ſcripte ſunt in libro Legis, From hence St. Paul,Gal.z. infer- reth there is no juſtification by the Law,and urgeth the Text according to the Septuagint. Now the Jewes to afford a latirude unto them-

terme omni, wherein lyeth the ſtrength of the Law, and of the Apo- ſtles argument ; butthe Samaritan Bible retained it right, and anſwe- rable unto what the Apoſtle had urged.
As for Chriſtians from whom wee ſhould expe the exaReſt and moſt concurring account, there is alſo in them a manifeſt diſag and ſuch as is not eaſily reconciled. For firſt, the Latins accord not in their account ; for to omit the calculation of the Ancients, of Auſtin, Bede, and others , the Chronology of the Modernes doth manifeſtly diflents for Joſephus Scaliger, whom Helvicus ſcemes to follow, ac- counts the Creation in 765. of the Julian period; and from thence ynto the nativity of our Saviour alloweth 3 947. yeares 3 But Dionyſius Pe- tavius a learned Chronologer difſenteth from this compute almoſt 40. yeares, placing the Creation in the 930, of the Julian period , and from thence unto the Incarnation accounteth 3983. yeares,
For the Greeks, their accounts are more anomalous ; for if wee re- curre unto ancient computes, we ſhall finde that Clemens Alexzandri- nus an ancient Father and preceptor unto Origen , accounted from the
Creation unto our Saviour, 5664. yeares; for in the firſt of his Stroma- | ticks , he colleReth the time from Adam unto the death of Commo- dus to be 5858. yeares z now the death of Commodus he placeth in | the yeare after Chriſt 194. which number dedued from the former
there remaineth 5664.Theophilus —__ Antioch accounteth unto the nativity of Chriſt 5515. deduceable from the like way of compute, for in his firſt booke ad Antolycam, he accounteth from Adam unto | Aurelius Verus 5695. yeares; now that Emperour dyed inthe yeare of
| 5515. Julius Africanns an ancient Chronologer,accounteth ſomewhat | lefle, that is, 5500. Euſebius Oroſius and others diflent not much from | this, but all excced five thouſand.
The latter compute of the Greeks, as Petavius obſcrveth, hath been reduced unto two or three accounts. The firſt acconnt unto our Savi- our 5501. and this hath beene obſerved by Nicephorus, Theophanes, and Maximus ; the other accounts 5509. And this of all at preſent is moſt generally received by the Church of c—_— , Obſerved alſo by the Moſcovite , as I have ſecne in the date of the Emperours letters, wherein this yeare of ours 1645. is from the yeare of the world 7154. which doth exactly agree unto this laſt account 55 09. for if un- co that ſumme be added 1645.the produR will be 91 54. by this Chro- nology are Grecke Authors to be underſtood ; and thus is Mar- tinus Cruſiusto be made out, when in his Turcogrzcian hiſtory he de- livers, the City of Conſtantinople was taken by the Turks in the yeare 54E « that is, 6961, and thus unto theſe iſts, the Prophecy | of Elias the Rabbin, ſo much in requeſt withthe Jews , and in ſome

yeaces ; unto theſe, I ſay, it hath beene long and out of memory dif proved for the ſabbaticall and 7000. yeare wherein the world ſhould cnd, (as did the Creation on the ſeventh day) unto them is long apoe expired, they are procceding in the cight thouſand yeare,and numbers exceeding thoſe days which men have made the types and ſhadows of theſe : But certainly what Marcus Leothe Jew conceaveth of the end of the heavens, exceedeth the account of all that ever ſhill be; for though he conceaveth the Elementall frame ſhall end inthe ſeventh or Sabbaticall millenary, yet cannot he opinion the heavens and more du- rable part of the Creation ſhall periſh before ſeven times ſeven, or 4g. that is, the Quadrant of the other ſeven, and perfeR Jubilie of thou ſands.
And thus may we obſerve the difference and wide diflent of mens
opinions, and there by the great incertainty in this eſtabliſhment. The| Hebrews not onely diſſenting from the Samaritans, the Lins from!) the Grecks, but every one from another ; inſomuch that all can be in
the right it is impoſſible , that any one is ſo, not with 3fſurance de-' terminable ; and therefore as Petavius confeſſerh, to cff-& the ſaine exaRly withouc inſpiration it is impoſſible, and beyond the Arichme:
tick of any but God himſelfe: And therefore alſo what ſatisfaRion may be obtained from thoſe violent diſputes, and eager erquirers in what day of the month the world began, either of March 0: Otober, likewiſe 1n what face or poſition of the Moone, whether at the prime or full, or ſoone after , let our ſecond and ſerious conſiderations de-
termine.
Now the reaſon and ground of this diflent, is the unhappy diffe- rence betweene the Greek and Hebrew editions of the B.ble, for unto theſe two Languages have all Tranſlations conformed ; the holy Sci pture being firſt delivered in Hebrew , and firſt tranſlated into Greek. For the Hebrew, it is incontroverttibly the primitive and ſureſt textto rely on, and to preſerve the ſame entire and uncorrupt, the;e hath been uſed the moſt apparent caution humanity could invent; For as R.Bes. Maimon hath declared, if in the copying thereof one letter were writ- ten twice, or if one letter but touched another , that copy was not ad- mitted into their Synagogues , but onely allowable to be rezd in Schooles, and private families ; neither were they carefull onely inthe exit number of their ſeRions of the Law, bur had alſothe curioſity to number every word, and affixed the account unto their ſeverall bocks: Natwithſtanding all which, divers corruptions enſued , and ſeveral! | depravations ſliptin, ariſing from many and mnifeſt grounds, as hath beene exaRly noted by Morinus in his preface unto the Septu1gint.

the richeſt ornament of his memorable Library z unto whom the high Prieſt addreſſed (ix Jews out of every Tribe , which amounteth unto 72. and by theſe was effeRted that Tranſlation wee uſually terme the |
int, or Tranſlation of ſeventy , which name however it obtaine from the number of their perſons, yet in reſpeR of one common Spirit, it was the Tranſlation but as it were of one man. For, as the tory re- lateth, although chey were ſet apart and ſevered from each other, yet *- | were their Tranſlations found to agrec in every point, according as is relared by Philo and Joſephus, although wee finde not the ſame in A- riſteus, who hath expreſly treated thereof.
This Tranſlation in ancient times was of great authority: By this many of the Heathens receaved ſome notions of the Creation and the mighty works of God ; This in expreſle termes is often followed by the Evavgeliſts, by the Apoſtles, and by our Saviour himſelfe in the quotations of the Old Teſtament. This for many years was uſed by the Jews themſelves, that is, ſuch as did Hellenize and diſperſedly dwelt out of Paleſtine withthe Greeks ; And this alſo the ſucceeding Chri- ſtians and ancient Fathers obſerved, although there ſucceeded other Greek verſions, that is, of Aquila, Theodoſius and Symmachus x for the Latin tranſlation of Jerome, called now the Vulgar , was about 800, yeares after, although we ſhall notdeny there was a Latin tranſls- tion before. called the Italick verſion, and Auſtin forbad that of Jerom to be uſed in his Dioceſle.
Whatſoever Interpretations there have beene fince, have been eſpe- cially effcRed with reference unto theſe , that is, the Greeke and He- brew text ; the Tranſlators ſometimes following the one, ſometimes adhering unto the other, according as they found them conſonant un- rotruth, or moſt correſpondent unto the rules of faith. Now however it commeth to paflc theſe two are very different in the enumeration of Genealogies, and particular accounts of time z for inthe ſecond inter- yall, that is betweene the floud and Abraham, there is by the S:ptua- gint introduced one Cainan fo be the ſon of Arphaxad and father of Salah, whereas in the Hebrew there is no mention of ſuch a perſon, but Arphaxad is ſet downe to be the father of $21ah. But in the firſt | intervall, that is, fromthe Creation unto the loud, their diſagreement is more conſiderable, for therein the Greek exceedetlythe Hebrew, and common account almoſt 600, yeares ; and "cis indeed a thing not | very ſtrange, to be atthe difference of athird part, in fo large and col- leQive an account, if wee conſider how differently they are ſet forth in minor and lefſe miſtakeable numbers. So in the Prophefie of Jonah, both inthe Hebrew and Latin rexr, it is ſaid, Yet forty dayes and Ni- nivy ſhall be overthrowne: Bur the Septuagint faith plainly, and that in letters at length , 95 #«#ezs, that is, yet three dayes and Ninivy ſhall be deſtroyed ; which is a diff-rence not newly crept _ an ob- |

Moreover,although the number of yeares be determined and right- ly underſtood, there be without doubt a certaine truth herein, yet the text ſpeaking obſcurely or dubiouſly, there is oft times no ſlender dif- ficulty at what point to begin or terminate the account, So when it is ſaid, Exod. 12. the ſojourning of the children of Iſrael who dwelt in Aoypt was 430. yeares, it cannot be taken ſtritly, and from their fiſt arivall into Agypt, for their habitation inthat land was farre lefle ; but the account muſt begin from the covenant of God with Abraham,and muſt alſo comprehend their ſojourne in the land of Canaan, according as is expreſſed, Gal.z. The Covenant that was confirmed before of Godin Chriſt, the Law which was 430. yeares after cannot diſanull.

Now ſuch isthe different conceit of theſe times, | that men have computed from all, but the probableſt account and moſt | concordant unto the intention of Jeremy,is from the ficſt of Nabucho- | donozer unto the firſt of King Cyrus over Babylon;al:hough the Pro- | phet Zachary ,ch3p. 1.12. accounteth fromthe laſt. O Lord of hoſtes, How long ! Wile thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem , againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten yeeres 2 for he ma. keth this expoſtulation inthe ſecond year of Darius Hiftaſpes, wherein he propheſied, which is about eighteene yeares in account after the other.
Thus alſo although there be a certaine truth therein, yet is there no eaſic doubt concerning the ſeventic weekes , or ſeventies times ſeven years of Daniel; whether they have reference unto the nativitie or pal- ſion of our Saviour, and eſpecially from whence , or what point of time they are to be computed; for thus is it delivered by the angel G+- briel : Seventy weekes are determined uponthy people; and againe in the following verſe : Know therefore and underſtand , that from the going forth of the Commandmentto reſtore and to build Jeruſalem unto the Mcſſirs the Prince , ſhall be ſeven weekes:, and threeſcore and two weekes , the ſtreet ſh1ll be built againe, :and the wall evenin troubleſome times; and after threeſcore and two weekes ſhall Mefſiah be cut off ; Now the going out of the Commandment to build the City, becing the point from whence to compute, there is no ſl:nder controverſic when to begin ; for there are no leſſe then foure ſeverall Edits to this effeR; the one in the firſt yeere of Cyrus,the other inthe ſecond of Darius, the third and fourth inthe ſeventh,and in the twen- tieth of Artaxerxes Longimanus ; although as Petavius accounteth ir beſt, 1ccordeth unto the twentie yeare of Artaxerxes, from whence Nehemiah deriveth his Commiſhon: Now that computes are made incertainely with reference unto Chriſt, it is no wonder , fince I per- ceive the time of his Nativitie is in controverſie, and no leſſe his age at | his Paſſion: For Clemens and Tertullian conceive he ſuffered at thir--) 'rie, but Irenzzux aTather nearer his time, is further off in his account, that is, betweene forty and fifty. |

this was alſo the confkitution of the firſt day: for when it was evening unto one longitude, it was morning unto another; when night unto one, day unto another , and therefore that queſtion whether our Saviour ſhall come againe inthe twilight, as is conceived he aroſe, or whether

So unto | thoſe which live under the Xquator, when the Sunne is in the Zqui- | Nox it is Summer , in which points ir maketh Spring or Autumne unto | us; and unto them it is alſo Winter when the Sun is in either Tropick; | whereas unto us it maketh alwayes Summer inthe one : And the like | will happen unto thoſe habitations, which are between the Tropicks, ' and the Xquator,

unto our times.
Now of theſe two, although the fiſt in ſome latitude may be re- tayned , yet is not the other in any to be admitted : -Forin regard of time (as we declare in the Chap.of canicular dayes) the ſtarres do vary their longitudes,and conſequently the times of their aſcention and dil- cention; That ſtarre which is theterme of numerationor point, from wher.ce we commence the account , altering his fite and longitude in

Apaine, in regard of different latitudes, this cannot be a fetled rule or reaſonably applyed unto many Nations; for whereas the ſetting of the Pleiades or ſeven ſtarres is defigned the terme of Autumne,and the beginning of Winter; unto ſome latitudes theſe ſtarres doe never ſet, as unto all beyond 67 degrees; and if in ſeverall and farre diſtant latitudes we obſerve the ſame ſtarre as a common terme of account unto both, we ſhall fall upon an unexpected, but an unſufferable abſurdity; and by | the ſame account it will be Summer unto us in the North, before it be ſo unto thoſe, which unto us are Southward,and many degrees approa-| ching nearer the Sun, For if we conſult the doRrine of the ſphere,and obſerve the aſcention of the Pleiades, which maketh the beginning of Summer, we ſhall diſcover that in the latitude of 40, theſe ſtarres ariſe in the 16 degree of Taurus; but inthe latitude of 50 they aſcend inthe

And therefore it is no wonder, nor any Paradox what is related by Luke, that the Diſciples upon the Deuteroproton, as they paſled by, lucked the ears of corne z for the Deuteroproton or ſecond firſt bart, was the firſt Sabbath after the deutera or ſecond of the Paſſeover, which was the ſixteenth of Niſan or Abib, and this is alſo evidenced from the received conſtruRion of the firſt and latter rayne , delivered Deut. 11.1 will give youthe rainof your land in his due ſeaſon, the firſt rain and the lattcr raine; for the firſt rayn fell upon the feed time about ORober,and was to make the ſeed to root,the latter was to fill the ear, and fell in Abib, or March the firſt monthy according as is expreſſed Joel 2.

For, as Hippecrates aff a man is hotteſt in the firſt day of his life, and coldeſt in the laſt ; his naturall ' heate ſetteth forth moſt vigorouſly at firſt,and declineth moſt ſenſibly at laſt. And ſo though the growth of man end not perhaps untill 21. yet in his ſtature more adyanced inthe firſt ſepteoary then in the ſe- cond, and in the ſecond, mare then inthe third , and more indeed in the firſt ſeven yeares, then in the fourteene ſucceeding : for, what ſta- ture we attaine unto at ſeven yeares, we do ſometimes but double,moſt times come ſhort at one and twenty. And ſoda we decline againe ; for inthe latter age upon theTropickand firſt deſcenſion from ourſolſtice, wee are ſcarce ſenſible of declination; but declining further, ' our decrement accelerates, we ſet apace, and inour laſt dayes precipitate into our graves. And thus are allo our progreſſions in the wombe, that is, our formation, motion, our birth or excluſion. For our formation is quickly effeRed, our motion appeareth later, and our excluſion very long after: if that be true which Hippocrates and Avicenna have de- clared, that the time of our motion is double unto that of formation, and that of excluſion treble unto that of motion; as if the Infant bee formed at 35. dayes,it moveth at 70. and is borne the 210. day, that is, the ſeventh month; or if it receaves not formation before. 45. dayes, ie moveth the 90. day, and is excluded in 270. that is, the 9. month. There are alſo certaine popular prognoſticks drawne from feſtivals inthe Calendar, and conceaved opinions of certaine dayes in months, ſo is there agenerall tradition in moſt parts of Europe, that inferreth

inlarge with our owne deduQions ; and this we ſhall endeayour from

all; for, had it ſtood ſtill, and were it fixed like the earth, there had beene then no diſtinRion of times, cither of day or yeare, of Spring,of Autumne, of Summer, or of Winter for thele ſcalonsare

His wiſdome is againe diſcernable not onely in that it moveth at all, and in its bare motion, but wonderfull in contriving the line of its re- volution; which from his artifice is ſo effeRed, that by a viciſſitude in one body and light, it ſufficeth the whole carth, affording thereby a poſſible or pleaſurable habitation io every part thereof, and that is the line Eclyptick, all which to effeR by any other circle it had beene im- poſſible. For firſt, if we imaginethe Sun to make his courſe out of the Eclyptick, and upon a line without any obliquity, let it be conceaved within that Circle, that is, either on the Xquator ., or.clſc on cither fide (for, if we ſhould place iteither inthe Meridian or Colures, beſide the ſubverſion of its courſe from Eaſt to Weſt, there would enſue the like incommodities.)

rr
ſphere, orſuchas havethe pole for their Zenith, it would have made
neither perfe& day nor night; for being in the Equator it would in- terſe their Horizon, and be halfe above, and halte beneath it; orra- ther it would have made perpetuall night to both : for though in re-
| gard ofthe rational Horizon, which biſſeeth the Globe into
parts, the Sunne inthe Aquator would interſeR the Horizon : yet in reſpeRof the ſenfible Horizon (which is defined by the eye) the Sun would bee viſible unto neither. For if as ocular witneſſes report, and fome doe alſo write , by reaſon of the connexity of the Eth the eye of man under the Aquator cannot diſcover both the poles, neither would rhe eye under the poles diſcover the Sunne in the B. quator. And thus would there nothing fruQifie either neare or under them, the Sunne being Horizontall to the poles, and of no con- fderable alritude unto parts a reaſonable diſtance from them. Apain, unto a right ſphere, or ſuch as dwell under the Aquator , although it made a difference in day and night , yet would icnot make any diſtin- Rion of feaſons : for unto them it would be conſtant Summer , it be- ing alwayes vertical], and never defleQing from them : So had there been no fruRtfication at all, and the Countries ſubjeRed would be # inhahitable, as indeed antiquity conceived them. |
Laſtly , it moving thus upon the Aquator , unto what poſition ſo- ever, although ic had made a day , yet could it have made no yeare; for it could not have had thoſe two motions now aſcribed unto it,that is, from Erſt to Weſt, whereby it makes the day, and likewiſe from Weſt to Ext, whereby the yeare is computed : for according to Aſtro- nomy,the'poles of the Aquator arethe {ame with thoſe of the Primum Mobile. Now it is impoſſible that on the ſame circle, having the ſame
| poles, both theſe motions from oppoſite termes, ſhould be at the ſame
ee
time performed, all which is/falved if we allow the Sunne an obliquity in his annuall motion, and conceive him to move upon the poles of the Lodiack , diſtant from theſe of the world 23 degrees and an halfe: And thus may we diſcerne the neceſſity of irs obl:quity , and how in- convenient its motion had been upon a circle parallell to the Aquator, or upon the Xquator it ſelfe.
Now with what providence this obliquity is determined , we ſhall evidently perceive upon the enſuing inconveniences from any deviati- on : for firſt, if its obliquity had been leffe, as inſtead of twenty three degrees, twelye or the halfc thereof, the viciflitude of ſeaſons appoin- red for the generation of all things , would ſurely have been too ſhot; for different ſeaſons would have hudled upon cach other, and unto ſome it had not been much betterthenif it had moved on the Equator: but had the obliquity beenpreater then now it is, as double or of 45.

Againe, it would be temperate to ſome habi- rations in the Summer, but very extreme inthe Winter ; temperate to thoſe in two or three degrees beyond the Artick Circle , as now it is unto us; for they would be equidiſt1nt from that Tropick, even as we are from this at preſent 3 but the Winter would be extreme, the Sun being removed above an hundred degrees, and ſo conſequently would not he viſible in their Horizon z no poſition of ſphere diſcovering ſtarre diſtant above go degrees, which is the diſtance of every Zeni from the Horizon. And thus if the obliquity of this Circle had been leſſe, the vicifſitude of ſeaſons had been ſo ſmall as not to be diſtingui- ſhed, if greater, ſo large and diſproportionable as not to be endured. Now for its ſituation, although it held this Eclypticke line, yet had ir been ſeated inany other Orbe, inconveniences would enſue of con- dition like the former, for had it been placed in the loweſt ſphere, and where is now the Moone, the yeare would have conſiſted but of one moneth , for in that ſpace of time it would have paſſed through ey
diſtinCtion of ſeaſons required for the generation and fruRifying of all things, contrary ſeaſons which deſtroy the effe&s of one another , ſo ſuddenly ſucceeding z beſides by this vicinity untothe earth its heat had been intollerable : for if (as many affirmie) there is a different ſenſe of heat from the different points of its proper orbe, and that in the A- pogeum or higheſt point (which happeneth in Cancer) it is notſo hot under that Tropick, on this fide the Aquator, as unto the other fide in the Perigeum or loweſt part of the eccentric (which happeneth in Ca- pricornus) ſurely being placed in an orbe farre lower, its heat would be unſufferable, nor needed we a fable to ſet the world on fire.

| Concerning the vulgar opinion that the carth was ſlenderly peopled before the | Floud.
Eſide the ſlender conſideration men of latter times doe hold of the
firſt ages, it is commonly opinioned, and at firſt thought generally imagined, that the Earth was thinly iphabited , at leaſt not remotely planted before the Floud ; ſothat ſome conceiving it needlefle to bee univerſal, have made the deluge particular,and about thoſe parts where Noah built his Arkez which opinion becauſe it is not only injurious to the Text, humane hiſtory, and common reaſon, but alſo derogatory unto that great worke of God,the univerſall inundation, it will be need- full to make ſome farther Inquiſttion; and (although predetermined by opinion ) whether many might not ſuffer in the firſt Flood , as they ſhall in the laſt Flame,that is who knew not Adam nor his offence,and many periſh in the deluge , whonever heard of Noah or the Arke of his preſervation.
Now for the true enquirie thereof, the meanes are as obſcure as the marter, which being naturally to be explored by Hiſtory humane or divine, receiveth thereby no ſmall addition.of obſcurity : for as for humane relations, they are ſo fabulous in Deucalions loud, that they are of little credit about Ogyges 8 Noah's; for the Heathens (as Varro accounteth) make three diſtinRions of time : the firſt from the begin- ning of the World unto the generall Deluge of Ogyges they terme, adelon; that is a time not much unlike that which was before time, im- manifeſt and unknowne , becauſe thereof there is almoſt nothing or

As for holy Scripture and divine relation, there may alſo ſceme therein but ſlender information, there being onely left a briefe narrati- on hereof by Moſes, and ſuch as afford no poſitive determination, For the text delivereth but two genealogies, that is, of Cain and Seth in the line of Seth there are onely ten deſcents, inthat of Cain but ſeven, and thoſe in a right line with mention of father and ſonne , excepting that of Lamech, where is alſo mention of wives, ſons, and adaughter: notwithſtanding if we ſhall ſcriouſly conſider what is delivercd there- in, and what is alſo deducible, it will be probably declared what is by us-intended, that is, the populous and ample habitation of the earth be» fore the floud, which wee ſhall labour to. induce not from poſtulates and entreated Maximes, but undeniable principles declared in holy Scripture, that is, the length of mens lives before the loud , and the large extent of time from the creation thereunto. We ſhall onely firſt crave notice, that although in the relation of Moſes there be very few perſons mentioned, yet are there many more to be preſumed; nor when theScriptureinthe line of Seth nominats but ten perſons, are they to be conceaved all that were of this generation; the Scripture fingly delivering the holy line, wherein the world was to be preſerved,firſt in Noah, and afterward in our Saviour. For inthis line it is manifeſt there were many more borne then are named ; for it is ſaid of them all, that they begat ſons and daughters. And whereas it is very late before it is faid they begat thoſe perſons which are na- med in the Scripture, the ſooneſt at 65. it muſt not be underſtood that they had none before , but not any in whom it pleaſed God the holy line ſhould be continued. And although that expreſſion that they be- gat ſons and daughters be not determined to be, before or afterthe mention of theſc, yet muſt it be before in ſome z for before it is ſaid that Adam begat Seth at the 130. yeare,it is plainly affirmed mage new

knew his wife, and had a ſon, which muſt be one ofthe daughters of | Adam, one of thoſe whereof itis after faid, hee begat ſons and daugh- | ters. And ſo for ought can be diſproved there might be more perſons | upon earth then are commonly ſuppoſed, when Cain flew Abel, nor the fact ſo hainouſly to be aggravated in the circumſtance ofthe fourth | perſonliving. And whereas it is ſaid upon the nativity of Seth , God hath appointed meanother ſced inſtead of Abel, it doth not imply he had no other allthis while, but not any of that expeRation, or appoin- ted ( as his name implies ) to make a progreſſion in the holy line , in | whom the world wasto be ſaved,and from whom he ſhould be borne, that was myſtically (laine in Abel.
Now our firſt ground to induce the numeroſity of people before the floud, is the long duration of their lives beyond 7. $. and 9. hun- dred yeares, which how it conduceth unto populofiry wee ſhall make but little doubt, if - —_— there = two maine cauſes of —_— fity in any kind or ſpecies, that is, a frequent and multiparous way 0 terniting, whereby they fill the world with others, though they exif not long themſclyes ; or a long duration and ſubfiſtence, whereby they doe not onely repleniſh the world with a new annumeration of others, but alſo maintaine the former account in themſelves. From the firſt cauſe we may obſerve examples in creatures oviparous, as birds and fiſhes; in vermiparous, as Flies, Locuſts, and Gnats, in animals alſo viviparous, as Swine and Conies; of the firſt there is agreat example inthe heard of Swine in Galilee, although it were an uncleane beaſt, and forbidden unto the Jews. Of the other a very remarkable one in Atheneus, in the Iſle Aſtipalea, one of the Cyclades now called Stam- palia, wherein from two that were imported,the number ſo encreaſed, that the Inhabitants were conſtrained to have recourſe unto the Oracle of Delphos, for an invention how to deſtroy them.
Others there are which make good the paucity of their breed with the length and duration of their dayes, whereof there want not ex- amples in animals uniparous : Firſt, in biſulcous or cloven hooft. as Ca- _—_ and Beeves, whereof there isabove a million annually ſlainein E : It is alſo ſaid of Job, that he had a thouſand yoake of Oxen,

erequite , they living commonly one hundred, "uo hundred yeares. Now although they be unuſuall with us in Europe, * | andaltogether unknowne unto America, yet in the two other parts they are abundant, as evidently appeares by the relation of Gorcias 4b Hort, Phyſitian to the Viceroy at Goa ; who in his Chapter de Zbore, relates that at one venation the King of Sian tooke foure thouſand, and is of opinion they are in other parts, in number then heards of Beeves in Europe. And though this delivered from a Spaniard un- | acquainted with our Northerne droves , may ſceme very farre to ex- cced, yet muſt we conceave them very numerous, if wee conſider the: number of teeth tranſported from one Countrey to another , they ha- ving onely two gremt teeth, and thoſe nor falling or renewing. | As for man the diſadvantage in his fingle iflue is the ſame with theſe, andinthe lateneſle of his generation ſomewhat greater then any; yet in the continuall and oot interrupted time thereof, and the extent of dayes , he becomes at preſent , if not then avy other ſpecics, atleaſt more numerous then theſe before mentioned. Now being thus nume- rous at preſent, and in the meaſure of threeſcore, foureſcore or an hun- dred years, iftheir dayes extended unto fixe, ſeven, or eight bundied, their generations would be proportionably multiplied ; their times of pR_ being not onely multiplyed, but their ſubſiſtence continued, orthough the great Grandchild went on, the Tycho or firſt Origiaall would ſubſiſt and make one of the world , though he outlived all the termes of conſanguinity, and became a ſtranger unto his proper proge- ny.So by compure of Scripture Adam lived unto the ninth generation, unto the dayes of Lamech the father of Noah ; Mcthuſclah unto the | yeare of the floud, and Noah was contemporary unto all from Enoch unto Abraham. So that although ſome dyed, the father bcholding ſo many diſcents, the number of {urvivers muſt ſtill be very great, for if halfe the men were now alive, which lived in the laſt Century, the carth would ſcarce comaine their number ; whereas in our abridged and ſeptuageſimall ages, itis very rare and deſerves adiftich to behold the fourth generation : Xerxes complaine ſtill remaining, and what he lamented in his Army , being almoſt deplorable inthe whole world, men ſeldome ariving unto thoſe yeares whereby Mcthuſelah exceeded

nine hundred, and what Adam came ſhort ofa thouſand, was defined long agoe to be the 2ge of man.
Now although the length of dayes conduceth maingly unto the nu- meroſity of mankinde , and it be manifeſt from Scripture they lived very long, yet is not the period of their lives determinable, and ſome might be longer livers, then we account that any were z For, (to omit that conceit of ſome, that Adam was the oldeſt man, in as much as he is conceaved to be created in the maturity of mankinde, that is, at 60.

Indeed of thoſe ten mentioned in Scripture with their ſeverall ages it muſt be true 5 but whether thoſe ſeven of the line of Caine and theit progeny, or any of the ſons or daughters poſterity after them outlived
thoſe , is not expreſſed in holy Scripture, and it will ſeeme more }
probable that of the line of Caine, ſome were longer lived then any of Seth, it we concede that ſeven generations of the one lived as long as
nine of the other. As for what is commonly alledged, that God |
would not it the life of any unto athouſand , becauſe (alluding
unto that of David ) no man ſhould live one day inthe fight of the |
Lord, although it be urged by divers, yet is it me thinks an inference
ſomewhat Rabbinicall, and not of power to perſwade a ſcrious exa- |
minator.
Having thus made manifeſt in generall how powerfully the length of lives conduced unto populoſity of thoſe times) it will > be cafe acknowledged it we diſcend to particularities,and conſider how many in ſeven hundred yeares might diſcend from one man; wherein con- ſidering the length of their dayes, we may conceave the greateſt num- ber to have beene alive fogether. And this that no reaſonable ſpirit may contradit, wee will declare with manifeſt difadyantage; for whereas the duration of the world unto the floud was above 1600. yeares, we will make our compute in lefle then halfe that time z nor will we begin with the firſt man, but allow the earth to bee provi- ded of women fit for marriage the ſecond or third firſt Centuries ; and will onely take as granted, that they might beget children at ſixty, and at an hundred yeares have twenty, allowing for that number _ yeares. Nor will we hercin ſingle out Methuſelah, or account from the longeſt livers, but make choice of the ſhorteſt of any wee finde recor- ded inthe Text, excepting Enoch 5 who after hee had lived as many yeares asthere be dayes in the yeare, was tranſlated at 365.

her the King of Arabia. About the ſame time of the Aſſyrian Mo- narchy, do Authors place that of the Sycionians in Greece, and ſoone after, that of the Argives, and not very long after, that of the Atheni- ans under Cecrops; and within our period aſſumed are hyſtorified ma. ny memorable ations of the Greekes, 2s the expedition of the Argo- nautes, with the moſt famous Wars of Thebes and Troy.
That Canaan alſo and Agypt were well peopled farre within this period, befides their plantation by Canaan and Miſraim,appeareth from the hiſtory of Abraham , who in leſſe then 400 yeares after the Flood journied from Meſopotamia unto Canaanand Agypt; both which he found well peopled and policied into Kingdomes ; wherein alſo in
430 yeares, fromthreeſcore and tenperſons which came with Jacob;
into Agypt he became a mighty Nation : for it is ſaid, at their depar- ture, there journyed from Rhameſis to Succoth about ſix hundred thouſand on foot , that were men beſides children.

The like might wer affirme from credible hiſtories both of France and Germany, and probably alſo out of our owne Country , for omit- ting the fabulous and Trojan originall delivered by Jeofrey of Mon- mouth, and the expreſle text of Scripture , that the race of J aphet did
le the Iſles of the Gentiles ; (in which number this ot ours hath has ſpecially accounted ) their originall was ſo obſcure in Czſars time, that he affirmeth the Inland inhabitants were Aborigines,that is, ſuch as reported , that they had their beginning in the Iſland That [reland our neighbour Iſland was not long time without Inhabitants, may be madeprobable by ſundry accounts, although we abate the Tra- dition of Barthvlawus the Scythian , who arrived there three hundred years after the Flood , or the relation of Giraldus , that Czſaria the daughter of Noah dwele there before. thoughwe have declared how largely the world was inhabi- ed within the ſpace of 1300 years, yet mult it be conceived more po- pulous then can be evinced ; for a greater part ofthe Earth hath ever been , then hath been known or deſcribed by Geographers, as will appeare by the diſcoveries of all ages; for neither in Herodotus or Thucydides do we finde any mention of Rome,nor inPtolomy of ma- ny parts of Europe, Afia,or Africa : and becauſe many places wee have declared of long plantation , of whoſe populoſity notwithſtanding or memorable aRions we have no ancient ſtory, if we may conjeRure of theſe by what we finde related of others, wee ſhall not need many words, nor aſſumethe halfe 1300 yeares, and this we might illuſtrate from the mighty as of the Aſſyrians performed not long after the Flood , and recorded by Juſtine and Diodorus, who makes relati- | on of expeditions: by Armies more numerous then have beene ever ſince. For Ninus King of Afyria brought againſt the BaRrians 700000 foot, 200000 horſe, 10600Chariots; Semiramis his ſucceſſor led againſt the Indians 1300000 foot, 500000 horſe, 100000 Chariots, and as many upon Camells : And it is ſaid, Staurobatesthe Indian King met

Againe , if any man imaginethe planta'ion of the earth more eaſic in regard of Navigation and ſhipping diſcovered fince the Flood, whereby the Iſlands and devided parts of the earth are now inhabited, | hee muſt conſider that whether there were Iſlands or no before the Flood is not yet determined , and is with probability denyed by very learned Authors.
Laſtly, if we ſhall fall into apprehenſion that it was lefſe inhabited, becauſe it is ſaid inthe fixt of Geneſis about 120. yeares before the Flood, and it came to paſſethat when men began to multiply upon the face of the carth : Beſide that this may be onely meant of the race of Cain, it will not import they were not mulciplyed before, but that they were at that time plentifully encreaſed ; for ſo is the ſame word uſed in other parts of Scripture. And fo is it afterward inthe 9g. Chap. ſaid that Noah began to be an husbandman, that is, he was ſo, or car- neſtly performed the Acts thereof : ſo it is ſaid of our Saviour that he
aQually caſt them our, or with alacrity effeRed it.

Cuay. VIL. Of Faſt and Weſt.
T He next ſhall be of Eaft and Weſt; thar is, the proprictics and con- ditions aſcribed unto Regions reſpeQively unto thoſe ſituations, which hath been the obvious conceptionof Philoſophers and Geo- graphers, magnifying the condition of India, and the Eaſterne Coun- tries, above the ſctting and occidentall Climates; ſome aſcribing here- tothe ation of gold, pretious ſtones, and ſpices, others the civi- lity and naturall endowments of men conceiving the bodies of this ſituation to receive a ſpeciall impreſſion from the firſt ſalutes of the Sunne,and ſome appropriate influence from his aſcendenr and oriental!

tions deduced from Exſt , Weſt, orthoſe obſervable points of the ſphere, how ſpecious and plaufible ſoever, will not upon enquiry bee juſtified from ſuch foundations.
For, to ſprake ſtrily, thete is no Eaſt and Weſt in nature; nor are thoſe abſolute and inyariable , but reſpeRive and mutable points , ac-
cording unto d:fferent longitudes,or diſtant parts of habitation, where- |
by they ſuffer many and conſiderable variations. For firft,unto ſome, the ſame part will beEaſt orWeſt in reſpeR of one another,that is,unto ſuch as inhabit the ſame parallel,or differently dwel from Eſt toWeſt; Thus as unto Spaine, Icaly lyeth Eaſt, unto Italy, Greece, unto Greece Perſia,8& unto PerfiaChinazſo again unto theCountry of China, Perſia lyeth Weſt , unto Perfia Greece, unto Greece Italy , and unto Italy

Spaine z ſo that the ſame Country is ſometimes Eaft and ſometimes Weſt, and Perfiathough Eaſt unto Greece, yet is it Weſt unto China,
Unto other habirations the ſame point will be both Eaſt and Weſt, as unto thoſe that are Antipodes or ſeated in points of theGlobe diame- trically oppoſed z ſothe Americans are Antipodall unto the Indians, and ſome part of Indiais both Eſt and Weſt unto America,according a$ it ſhall be regarded from one ſide orthe other, tothe right or to the left ; and ſetting out from any middle point, either by Eaſt or Weſt, the diſtance unto the place intended is equall, and inthe ſame ſpace of cime if nature alſo performable.
To a third that havethe Poles for their vertex, .or dwellin the poſi- tion of a parallell ſphere, there will be neither Exſt nor Weſt, at leaſt the greateſt pit of the year, for if ( asthe name Orientall implyeth) they ſhall acconnt that part to be Eaſt where ever the Sunne ariſcth, or that Weſt where the Sunne is occidentall or ſetteth , almoſt halte the yeare they have neither the one nor the other z for halfe the yeare it is below their Horizon,and the other halfe it is continually above it; and circling round about them interſeReth not the Horizon,nor leaveth any part for this compure. And if(which will at firſt ſcem very reaſonable) chat part ſhould be tearmed the Eaſterne point, where the Sunne at the Aquinox, and but once in the yeare ariſeth, yet will this alſo diſturbe the Cardinall accounts , nor will it with propriety admit that appella- tion : For that ſurely cannot be accounted Eaſt which hath the South on both ſides, which notwithſtanding, thispoſition muſt have ; for if unto ſuch as live under the pole , that be only Nonth which is above them , that muſt be Southerly which is below them , which is all the other portion of the Globe befidethat part poſſeſſed by them. And thus theſe points of Eaſt and Weſt being not abſolute io any, reſpeRive in ſome, and not at all relating unto others, we cannot hereon eſtabliſh ſo generall conſiderations, nor reaſonably creR ſuch immutable aſſer- tions, upon ſo unſtable foundations, ' - -.
Now the ground that begat or promoted this conceit z was firſt a

miſtake inthe apprehenſion of Eaft and Weſt,confidering thereof as of the North and South, and computing by theſeas invariably as b
the other, bur herein, upon ſecond thoughts there is a great diſparity: For the North and Southerne pole, are the invariable termes of that Axis whereon the heavens dec move , and are therefore incommuni- cablc and fixed points whereof the one is not apprehenfible in the other ; but with the Eaſt and Weſt it is quite otherwiſe, for the revo- lution of the Orbes being made upon the poles of North and South, all other points about the Axis are mutablez and whereſoever therein the Eaſt point be determined, by ſucceſſion of parts in one revolution every point becommeth Eaſt : and ſo if where the Sunne ariſeth, that [part betearmed Eaſt , every habiration differing in longitude , will | have this pointalſo different, in as much as the Sunne ſucceſſively ari- ſeth unto every one.
| Theſccond ground, although it depend upon the former, approa-  cheth nearer the effe ; and that is the efficacie of the Sunne , ſet out
\and divided according to priority of aſſent, whereby his influence is |
conceived more favourable unto one Country then another , and to |felicitate India more then - after. But hereby we cannot avoid 2b- | ſurdities and ſuch as infer effects controulable by our ſenſes : For firſt, | by the ſame reaſon that we affirm the Indian richer then the American, the American willalſo be more plentifull then the Indian, and Eng- land or Spaine more fruitfull then Hiſpaniola or golden Caſtile; in as much as the Sunne ariſeth unto the one ſooner then thepther , and ſo accountably unto any Nation ſubjeRed untothe ſame parallcll,or with a conſiderable diverſity of longitude from each other.
Secondly,an unſuffcrable abſurdity will enſue; for thereby a Coun- try may be more fruitfull then ir ſelte : For India is more fertile then Spaine , becauſe more Eaſt , and that the Sunne ariſeth firſt unto it; Spaine likewiſe by the ſame reaſon more fruitfull then America, and
which a lefle fertile Country then it ſelfe, excelleth.
Laſtly, if we conceive the Sunne hath any advantage by the priority of its aſcent,or makes thereby one Country more happy then another, we introduce injuſtifiable acceptions ; and impoſe anaturall partia- lity on that luminary , which being equidiſtant from the Earth,
4
America then India, ſo that Spaine is lefle fruicfull then that Country,
and cqually removed in the Eaſt as inthe Weſt, his power ahd efficacie in both places muſt bee equall , as Boetius hath taken notice in his firſt de Gems, and Scaliger hath graphically declated in-his Exercitations z ſome have therefore forſaken this refuge of | the Sunne, and to ſalve the effeR have recurred unto the influence of the ſtarres, making their aRivities Nationall , and appropriating their | powers unto particular regions : So Cardan conceiveth the tayle of Urſa major peculiarly reſpeReth Europe , whereas indeed once in 24 | Qq 2 houres

houres it alſo abſolveth its courſe over Aſia and America : And thete- fore it will not be cafic to apprehend thoſe ſtars peculiarly glance on us, who muſt of neceſſity carry a commoneye and regard unto all Countrics unto whom their revolution and verticity is alſo common.
The cffcs therefore are different produRions in ſeverall Countries, which we impute unto the aRion of the Sunne , mult ſurely have nea- | rer and more immediate cauſes then that Luminary z and theſe if wee place in the propriety of the clime, or condition of {oyle wherein the are produced, we ſhall more reaſonably proceed , thenthey who al- ctibethem unto the aRivity of the Sunne, whoſe revolution being re- gular , it hath no power nor efficacie peculiar from its orientality , but equally diſperſeth his beames unto all which equally and in | the ſame reſtriRion receive his luſtre z and being ao univerſall and in- definite agent, the effeRs or produRions we behold, receive not their | Circle from his cauſality , butare determined by the principles of the place or qualities of that region which admits them: and this is evident
not onely in gemmes, mineralls, and metalls, but obſervable in plants | and animalls, whereof ſomeare common unto many Countries, ſome
uliar unto one , ſome not communicable unto another : For the
hand of God that firſt created the earth, hath with variety diſpoſed the principles of all things , wiſely contriving them in their proper ſemi- naries , and where they beſt maintaine the intention of their ſpecies; whereof if they have not a concurrence , and be not lodged in a con- renicnt matrix , they are not excited by the efficacle of the Sunne, or | fayling in particular cauſes receive a relicfe or ſufficient promotion | | from the univerſall. For although ſuperiour powers cooperate with io-
feriour aRivities , and may ( as ſome conceive ) carry a ſtroake inthe | plaſticke and formative draught of all things, yer doe their determina- | tions belong unto particular agents, and are defined from their proper principles. Thus the Sunne which with us is fruitfull in the generation of frogs , toads, and ſerpents, tothis effeR proves impotent in our | neighbour Iſland; wherein as in all other carrying a common aſpe, it concurreth but unto prediſpoſed effeRts, and onely ſuſcitates thoſe formes, whole determinations are ſeminall,and proceed from the Idea ofthemſelycs.
Now wheras there be many obſervations concerningEaſt,and divers conſiderations of Art which ſeeme to extoll the quality of that point, if rightly underſtood they doe not really promote it. That the Aſtro- loger takes account of nativities from the Aſcendent, that is, the firſt houſe of the heavens, whoſe beginning is toward the Eaſt, it doth not
the Oriencality thereof, but conſidereth-therein his firſt aſcent aboye

Now this aſcenſion indeed falls out reſpe- Qively in the Eaſt z but as we have delivered before, in ſome poſitions there is no Eaſterne point from whence to compute thele alcenfions. Sois it ina parallel ſpheare : for, unto them fix houſes are continually depreſſed, and fix never elevated; and the Planets themſelves, whoſe re- yolutions are of more ſpeed, and influences of higher conſideration, muſt finde in that place a very imperfeR regard ; for halfe their period they abſolve above, and halfe beneath the Horizon; and ſo for fix yeares, no man can have the happineſſe to be borne under Jupiter, and for fiftcene together all muſt eſcape the aſcendent dominion of Sx eurne. |
That Ariſtotle in his Politicks , commends the fituxtjon of a City which is open towards the Eaſt , and admitteththe rayes of the rifing Sun, thereby is implyed no more particular efficacy then in the Welt ; But that fite is commended, in regard the damps and yaporous exhala- tions ingendered in the abſcnce of the Sun, arg by his returning rayes the ſooner diſpelled, and men thereby more early enjoy a cleare and | healthy habitation, and upontheſe and the like conſiderations icis,that

For the Tribe of Judah bcheld it to the North z, Manafſes, Zabulon, and Nap | thali unto the South , Ruben and Gad unto the Weſt z onely the T:ibe of Dan regarded it directly or tothe due Eft : and ſo when it is ſaid Luke 12. when you ſcea cloud riſe out of the Weſt, you ſay there | commeth a ſhowre, and ſo it is ; the obſervation was reſpeRive unto | Judea nor is this'a reaſonable illation in all other Nations whatſoever, | For the Sea lay Weſt unto that Country, and the winds brought raine | | from that quarter z But this conſideration cannot be transferred unto India or China, which have a vaſt Sea Eaſtward, and a vaſter Conti- nent toward the Weſt. So likewiſe when it is ſaid by Job, in the vul- | 1 -anſlation, Gold commeth out of the North , is this a reaſonab!: | inducement unto us and many other Countries , from ſome particular mines ſeptentrionall unto his ſituation, to ſearch after that metall in cold and Northerne regions, which wee moſt plentifully diſcover in hot and Southerne habitations ?
For the Mahometans as they partake with all Religions in ſome- thing, ſo they imitate the Jew in this, Far in their obſerved geſtures, | they hold a regard unto Mecha and Medina Talnabi, two Citics in 4- rabis falix ; where their Pcophet was borne and buried; whither they performe their pilgrimages ; and from whence they expeR he ſhould refurne againe. And thetefore they direR their faces unto theſe parts, which unto the Mahometans of Barbary and Z9ypt lycEiſt, and arc in ſome point thereof, unto many other parts of Turkey : wherein not- withſtanding there is no Orieotall reſpeR; for with the ſame devotion | on the other fide they regard theſe parts toward the Weſt, avd ſo with variety whereſoever they are ſeated , conforming unto the ground of their conception.

Thus much is implyed by the Orciginall , and exprefled by Tranſlations which ſtrialy coaforme thereto : So Tremellius and Junus,Coftra habentinme ab anteriore parte | oriemtem verſus vexilſum eſto caſtrorum Inds, (o hath R.Solomon Jar- chi expounded it, the foremoſt or before, isthe Exiſt quarter, and the Weſt 1s called behind : And upon this Interpretation may all be ſalyed that is alleageable againſt if, Foritthe Tribe of Judah were to pitch beforethe Tabernacle at the Eaſt , and yet to march firſt , as is com- manded Numb. 10. there muſt enſue a diſorder inthe Campe, nor could they conveniently obſerve the cxecution thereof : For when they ſet out from Monnt Sinah where the Command was delivered, they made Northward unto Rithmahz from Rifſah unto Fzionbeber 2bout fourteen ſtations they marched South:From Almon Diblathaim through the mountaines of Yabarim and plaines of Moab towards | Jordan the face of their march was Weſt : Sothatit Judah were ſtrialy to pitch in the Eaſt of the Tabernacle,every night he encamped in the Reare : And if (as ſome conceive)the whole Campe could not | be lefſe then twelve miles long , it had been prepoſterous for him to | have marched foremoſt, or ſet out firſt, who was moſt remote from the | place to be approached. | Fifthly, that Learning, Civility and Arts, had their beginning in | the Eaſt, it is not imputable either to the aRion of the Sunne,or its Oti-|  entality , but of the firſt plantation of Man in thoſe parts, which unto ; | Europe doe carry the reſpeR of Eaſt; for on the mountaines of Araraf, | that is part of the hill Taurus, between the Eaſt-Indies and Scythia, as Sir W.Ralegh accounts it, the Arke of Noah reſted ; from the Eaſt they travelled that built the Tower of Babell, from thence they were diſperſed and ſucceſfively enlarged, and learning good Arts and all Ci- vility communicated.

Laftly , that the Globe it ſelfe is by Coſmographers divided into Eaſt and Wcſt,accounting fromthe fictt Meridian,it doth not eſtabliſh this conceit; for that diviſion is not naturally founded, but artificially ſet downe, and by agreement; as the apteſt termes to define or com- menſurate the longitude of places. Thus the ancient Coſmographers doe place the diviſion of the Eiſt and Weſterne Hemiſphere , that is che fiſt terme of longitude inthe Canary or fortunate Iflands; concei- vipg theſc parts the extreameſt habitations Weſtward : But the Mo- dernes have altered that terme and tranſlated it unto the Azores or Mi- chaels Iſlands , and that upon a plauſible conceit of the ſmall or inſen- fible variationof the compaſlc in thoſe parts ; wherein neverthelefle, and though upon ſecond inyention, they proceed upon a common and no appropriate foundation, for even in that Meridian farther North or South the compaſſe obſervably varieth; and there are alſo other places whercin it varicthnot , as Alphonſo and Rodoriges de Lago will have it about Caps de Lav Agullas in Africa z as Maurolycus affirmeth inthe ſhore of Pcloponeſus 1n Europe, and as Gilbertusaverreth, in the mid- deſt of great regions, in moſt parts of the carth.

Cnay. VIIL Of the River Nilns,
FF uncontroulably and under generall conſent many opinions are paſfant, which notwithſtanding upon due examination, do ad- mit of doubt or reſtriRion : It 15 generally eſteemed, and by moſt unto our dayes received, that the River of Nilus hath ſeven oſtiaries; that is, by ſeven Channells disburdencrth it ſclfe into the Sea 3 wherein not- withſtanding, befide that we finde no concurrent determination of ages paſt, and a poſitive and undeniable refute of theſe preſent, the affirma- tive is mutable, and muſt not be received without all limitation.
For ſome, from whom wee receive the greateſt illuſtrations of Antiquity, have made no mention hereof : So Homer hath given no number of its Channells , nor ſo much as the name thereof in uſe with all Hiſtorians. Eratoſthenes in his deſcription of Xgypt hath likewiſe fed them over: Ariſtotle is ſo indiftinR in their names and numbers, that in the firſt of Meteors, he plainly affirmeth the Region of ZAgypt, which we eſteem the ancicnteſt Nation in the World , was a meere gained ground ; and that by the ſctling of mud and limous matter brought downe by the River Nilus,that which was at firſt a continued Sea, was rayſedatlaſt into a firme and habitable Country.

eaich brought downe thereby , it grew obſcrvably ſtallower in his dayes,and would in procefle of time become a firmeland. And though his conjeRure be not as yet fulfilled , yet is the like obſervable in River Gihon, a branch of Euphrates and River of Paradiſe, which ha- ving in former Ages diſcharged it ſelfe into the Perſian Sea, doth at preſent fall ſhort, being loſt in the lakes of Chaldea, and hath left be- | tweene the Sea, a large and conſiderable part of dry land. Others expreſly treating hereof have diverſly delivered themſelves ; Herodotus in his Euterpe makes mention of ſeven, but careleſly of tw# thereof ; that is, Boib1tihnum, and Bucolicum , for theſe, ſaith he, were not the naturall currents, but made by Art for ſome occafionall con- venience. Strabo in his Geography naming but two , Pelsfiacum and Canopicum, plainly affirmeth there were many more then ſeven, Ter bec alia quing, &c.There are ({aith he) many remarkable townes with- inthe Currencs of Nile, eſpecially ſuch which have given the names

all chagnels of Herodotus is accounted : Ptolomy an Zgyptian, and borne at the Pcluſian mouth of Nile, in his phy maketh nine, and in the third Map of Africa, hath unto their mouths prefixed their ſeverall names, that is, Heracleoticum, Bolbitinum, Sebenneticum, Pi- neptum, Diolcos, Pathmeticum, Mendeſium , Taniticum, Pelenfiacum
unto the oſtearies thereof, not unto all, for they are eleven, and foure |
wherein notwithſtanding there are no lefſe then three different names
trom thoſe delivered by Pliny : All which conſidered, we may cafily | diſcerne that Authors accord not either in name or number , and muſt / needs confirme the Judgement of Maginus, de Oſtiorum , Nili numers ; & nominibus, valde awtiqui ſcriptares diſcordant. |
Moderne Geographers and travellers do much abate of this number; for as Maginus and others obſerve , there are now but three or foure mouths thereof, as Guliclmus Tyrius long agoe , and Bellonius fince, both ocular enquirers, with others have atteſted. For below Cairo, the River devides it ſelfe into foure branches , whereof two make the chicfe and navigable ſtreames , the one running to Peluſium of the Ancients,and now Damiats ; the other unto Cangpium and now Roſcet- #4, the other two, ſaith Mr. Sandys, doe runne betweene theſe , but poore in water z of thoſe ſeven mentioned by Herodotus , and thoſe nine by Pcolomy, theſe arc all I could either ſee, or heare of.
Laſtly, what ever was or is their number , the contrivers of Cards and Maps, afford us no aſſurance or conſtant deſcription therein. For | whereas Ptolomy hath ſet forth nine, Hondius in his Map of Africa, | makes but eight, and inthat of Europe ten. Ortelius in his Theatrum

that of Agypt eleven, and Maginus in his Mp of that Countrey hath obſerved the ſame number z and if we enquire farther , wee ſhall finde che ſame diverfity and diſcord in divers others.
And thus may we perceave that this account was differently related by the Ancients, that it is undeniably rejected by the Modernes, and muſt be warily received by any. For if wee receave them all into ac- count, they were more then ſeven, It onely the naturall fluces they were fewer ; and however we reccave them, there is no agreeable and conſtant deſcription thereof. And therefore how reaſonable it is to draw continuall and durable deductions from alkerable and uncertaine foundations, let them conſider who make the gates of Thebes , and the mouthes of this River a conſtant and continued periphrafis tor this number, and intheir Poeticall expreſſions do give the River that Epi- thite unto this day z conceaving a perpetuity in mutability , and upon unſtable foundations ercQiog eternall aſſertions. |
The ſame River is alſo accounted the greateſt of the earth , called therefore Flavierem pater, and t58ims Orbis maximus by Ortelius ; with the verity hereof, I confeſle I could be well contented , nor do I wiſh the ruine of this afſertiooznevertheleſlc it this be true, many Maps muſt be correRed, or the relations of divers good Authors renounced.
For firſt, inthe deliniations of many Maps of Africa; the River Ni- gerexceedcth it about ren degrees in length, that is, no leſſe then fix hundred miles. For,ariſfing beyond the Aquator irmaketh Northward almoſt 15. degrees, and defleRing after Weſtward, wichout meanders, cominueth a ſtrait courſe about 40.degrees 5 and with many great cur- | rents disburdeneth it ſclfe into the Occidentall Ocean. Againe, if wee credit the deſcriptions of good Authors, other Rivers excell it in
or breadth, ot both, Arrianus in his hiſtory of Alexander, aſ- ſigneth the firſt place unto the River Ganges , which truly according unto later relations, if not in length, yet in breadth and debth may bee granted toexcell it : For the magnitude of Nilus cooſiſteth inthe di-
it maintaineth beyond Syene or Aſna , and fo forward unto its origi- nall, relations are very imperfeRt, but below theſe places and farther removed from the head, the current is but narrow ; and we reade in the hiſtory of the Turks, the Tartar horſemenof Selimus, ſwam over the Nile from Cairo, to meet the forces of Tonombeius ; Scortiasthe Je- ſuite expreſly treating hereof, the River of Plate in America; for that as Maffeus hath delivered. fallcth into the Occan in the latitude of forty Leagues, and with that ſource and plenty that men at Sea doe taſte freſh water, before they ſo neere as to diſcover the land: So is it exceeded by that which by Cardan is termed the greateſt in the world, that is the River Orcgliana in the fame Continent, which as

Channell of ninety leagues broad z ſothat, as Acoſta an ocular wit- neſſe recordeth , they that ſayle in the middle , can make no land of either (ide.
Now the ground of this aſſertion was ſurely the magnifying eſteem ofthe Ancients, ariſing from the indiſcovery of its head. For as things unknowne ſeeme greater then they are, and are uſually receaved with amplifications above their nature z So might it alſo be with this River, whoſe head being unknowne and drawne to a proverbiall obſcurity, the opinion thereof became withont bounds,and men muſt needs con- ceat a large extent of that to which the diſcovery of no man had ſet a period. And this an uſuall way to give the ſuperlative unto things of eminency inany kinde : and when a thing is very great, preſently to define itto be the greateſt of all ; whereas indeed Superlatives are dif- ficule, whereof there being but one in every kinde , their determinati- ons are dangerous, and muſt not be made without great circumſpeRi- \ on. Sothe City of Rome is magnified by the Larins to be the greateſt of the earth , but time and Geography enforme us, that Cairo is bigger then ever it was, and Quinſay in China farre exceedeth both. So is Olympus extolled by the Greeks, asan hill attaining unto heaven , but che enlarged Geography of after times makes ſlight account hereof, when they diſcourſe of Andes in Peru , or Teneriffa in the Canaries. So haveall Ages conceaved, and moſt are ſtill ready to ſweare, the | Wrenis the leaſt of birds, yet the diſcoveries of America, and even of our owne Plantations haye ſhewed us one farre lefle, that is, the Hum- bird, not much exceeding a Beetle. And truly, for the leaſt and grea- teſt, the higheſt and the loweſt of every kinde, as it is very difficult to define them in viſiblethings , ſo is it to underſtand inthings inviſible. Thus is it nocafie leflon to comprehend the firſt matter , and the affe- ions of that which is next neighbour unto nothing ; and impoſſible truly to comprehend God, who indeed is all things; and ſothings as they ariſe unto perfeRion, and approach unto God, or deſcend to im- perfeRion, and draw neerer unto nothing, fall both imperfeRly into our apprehenſ1ons ; the one being too weake for our conception, our conception too weake for the other. |
Thirdly , divers conceptions there are concerning its increment or inundation. The firſt unwarily opinions, that this encreaſe or annuall overflowing is proper unto Nile, and not agreeable unto any other Ri- ver; which notwithſtanding is common unto many currents of Africa; For about the ſame time the River Niger, and Zaire do overflow, and ſodo the Rivers beyond the mountaines of the Moone, as Suama, and Spirito Santo : and not onely theſe in Africa, but ſome alſo in Europe and Afia for ſo it is reported of Menan in India, and ſo doth Botero report of Duina in Livonia, and the ſame is alſo obſervable inthe Ri-
ver Jordan in Judea for ſo is it delivered Joſuah 3. that Jordan over- & floweth |

The effeR indeed is wonderfull in all, and the cauſes ſurely beſt reſolvable from obſervations made inthe Countries themſelves , the parts through which they pafſe, or whence they take their original! That of Nilus hath beene attempted by many, and by ſome to that de- ſpaire of reſolution, that they have only referred it unto the providence of God, and the {ecret manudaRion of all things unto their ends , but divers have attained the truth , and the cauſe alledged by Diodorus, Seneca, Strabo and others is allowable z that the inundation of Nilus in Agypt proceeded from the raines in Athiopia, and the mighty ſource of waters falling towards the fountaines thereof, For, this in- undation unto the Agyptians happeneth when it is winter unto the Xthiopians 3 which habitations , alchough they have no cold winter, the Sun being no farther removed from them in Cancer, then unto us in Taurus ; yet is the fervour of the ayre ſo well remitted , as it admits a ſufficient generation of vapours, and plenty of ſhowres cnſuing there- | upon. . This theory of the Ancients is fince confirmed by experience of the Modernes, as namely by Franciſcus Alvarez who lived loog in thoſe parts , and hath left a deſcription of Achiopiaz affirming that from the middle of June unto September , there fell in his time con- | tinuall raines, As alſo Antonius Ferdinandus,who in an Epiſtle written from thence, and noted by Condignus, affi-meth that during the win- ter, in thoſe Countries there paſſed no day without raine.
Now this is alſo an uſuall courſe to tranſlate a remarkable quality in- roa propriety, and where we admire an effeR in one, to opinion there is not the like in any other, with theſe conceits do common apprehen- ſions entertaine the antidotall and wondrous condition of Ireland ; conceaving in that Land onely an immunity from venemous creatures; but unto him that ſhall further enquire , the ſame will be affirmed of | Creta memorable in ancient ſtories , even unto fabulous cauſes and benediRion from the birth of Jupiter : The ſame is alſo found in Ebu. ſus or Eviſa, an Ifland neere Majorca upon the coaſt of Spaine. With theſe opinions dothe eyes of neighbour ſpeRators behold Ana, the. flaming mountaine in Sicilia ; But Navigators tell us there is a burning mountaine in Iſland , a more remarkeable one in Teneriffa of the Ca-

Thus Crocodiles were thought to be peculiar unto Nite, and the opinion ſo poſſeſſed Alexander, that when he had diſcovered ſome in Ganges, he fell upon conceit he had found the head of Nilus ; but later diſcoveries affirme | y are not onely in Aſia and Africa,but very frequent in ſome Rivers

Againe, were the day definitive it had preventcd the deluſion of the Devill, nor could he have gained applauſe by its predition, who (not- withſtanding as Athanaſius inthe life of Anthony relateth)to fie | his knowledge in things to come, when he perceived the rains to tall in Xthiopia,would preſage unto the Agyptians the day of its inundation. And this would alſo make uſclefſe that naturall experiment obſerved incarth or ſand about the River, by the weight whereof (as good An- chors report) they have unto this day, a knowledge of its encreale.

lar, and therefore their effeRs not prognoſticable like Eccliples; for depending upon the clouds and def- cent of ſhowres in Z:hiopia , which have their generation from vapo- rousexhalations, they muſt ſubmit their exiſtence unto contingencies, and endure anticipation and receſſion from the moveable condition of their cauſes. And therefore ſome yeares there hath been no encreaſe at all, as Seneca and divers relate of theeleventh yeare of Cleopatra, nor nine yeares together, as is teſtified by Caliſthenes. Some yeares it hath alſo retarded , and came far later then uſually it wasexpeRtcd, as according to Sozomen and Nicephorns it happened inthe dayes of Theodofius ; whereat the people were ready to mutiny, becauſe they might nor ſacrifice unto the River according to the cuſtome of their Predeceſſors.

That Whelps are blinde nine dayes , and then begin to ſee is generally beleeved; but as we have elſewhere declared, it is exceeding rare, nor doe theireyec-lids uſually open untill the twelfth , and ſometimes not before the fourteenth day. And to ſpeake ftriftly an hazardable de- termination it is unto fluuating and indifferent effes, to affixe a poſi- tive type or period ; for in effeRs of far more regular cauſalities diffi- culties doe often ariſe, and even intime it ſelfe which meaſureth all things, we uſe allowance in its commenſuration. Thus while we con- ceive we have the account of a year in 365 dayes , exaR enquirers and computiſts will tell us, that we eſcape 6 houres, thatis a quarter of a day; and ſo ina day which every one accounts 24 houres, or one revo- | lutionof the Sunne 3 io ſtri account we muſt allowthe addition of ſucha part as the Sunne doth make in his proper motion, from Weſt to Eaſt, whereby in one day he deſcribeth not a perfe& circle.
Fourthly , it is affirmed by many, and received by moſt, that it ne- ver raineth in Agyprt, the River ſupplying that defeR, and bountifully requiting it in its Inundation : but this muſt alſo be received ina qua- lified ſenſe , that is , that it raines but ſeldome at any time inthe Sum- mer, and very rarely in the Winter. But that gceat ſhowres do ſome- times fall upon that Region, beſide the aſſertion of many Writers, we can confirme from honourable and ocular teſtimony, and that not ma- ny yeares paſt, it rayned in Grand Cairo 8 or 9 dayes together. Beſide men hereby forget the relation of holy Scripture, as is delivered Ex.g. Behold I will cauſe it to raine a very grievous haile, ſuch as hath nor been in Agypt ſince the foundation thereof even untill now : wherein God threatning ſuch a raineas had not happened, it muſt be preſumed they had been acquainted with ſome before; and were not ignorant of the ſubſtance, the menace being made inthe circumſtance.
Now this miſtake ariſeth trom a miſapplication of the bounds or limits of time, and an undue tranfition from one unto another z which to avoid we muſt obſerve the punRuall differences of time, and ſo rea- ſonably diſtinguiſhthereof , as not to confound or loſe the one in the other. For things may come to paſſe, Semper, Pleramg, .

Laſtly, it is commonly conceived that divers Princes have ted to curthe Iſthmus er tra of land which parteththe Arabian, and Mediterrancan Seaz but wherein upon enquiry I finde ſome difficulty concerning the place attempted; many with good authority afficming, that the intent was not immediatly to unite theſe Seas , but to make 2 navigable channell betweene the Red Sea and the Nile, the markes whereof are extant to this day; it was firſt attempted by Serſoſtris,after by Darius, and in a feare todrowne the Country deſerted by them both, but was loog after re- attempted, and in ſome manner effeRed by Philadelphus ; and fothe Grand Signior who is Lord of the Country, conveyeth his Gallyes into the Red Sea by the Nile z for he bringeth them downe to Grand Cairo where they are taken in pzeces , carryed upon Carnels backs, and rejoyned together at Sues, his port and navall ſtation for that Sea , whereby in effeR he aRxthe defigne of Cleaps- tra, who after the battell of AQium,in a different way would have car veyed her Gallies into the Red Sea. And therefore that proverbeto cut an Iſthmus, that is to take great paines , and effeR nothing , alludeth not unto this attempt ; but is by Eraſmus applyed unto ſeverall other , as that undertaking of Coidians ro cut their Iſthmus, but eſpecially that of Corinth ſo unſucceſſefully attempted by many Emperors. The Coidians weredeterred by the peremptory diſſwaſion of Apollo, plain! ing them to defift; forif God had thought it fit , hee have made that an ! [land at ficſt.

rubr as alicub1 eſſe maris 4quas , quin ab Erythrorege nomen pel1go ind;- tw ; of this opinion was Andrzas Corlalius, Plinie, Solinus, Dio, Caflius, who alchough they denyecd not all redneſle, yet did they relye upon the originall from King Erythrus.
O. hers have fallen upon the like, or perhaps the ſame conceit under | another appeHKation ; deducing its name not from King Erythrus but Eſau or Edom whoſe habitation was upon the coafts thereot : Now Edom is as much as Erythrus , and the Red Sea no more then the Idu- mean;from whence the poſterity of Edom removing towards the Me- diterranean coaſt;according to their former nomination by the Greeks were called Phznicians or red men, and from a plantation and colony of theirs an I{l:nd neere Spaine, was by the Greek deſcribers termed Erythra, as is declared by $crabo and Solinus.
Very many omitting the nominall derivatiori doe reſt inthe grofle and literall conception chereof, apprehending a reall rednefle and con- ſtant colour of parts. Of which opinion are alſo they which hold the Sea receiveth a red and mimous tinure from ſprings, wells, and cur- rents , that fall intoit : and of the ſame belicfe are probably many Chriſtians who conceiving the paſſage of the I{raclites through rhis
=
Sea to have been the type of Baptiſme, according to that of the Apo- ſtle, All were baptiſed unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the Sea, for the better reſemblance of the bloud of Chriſt, they willingly received it in the apprehenſion of rednefle, and a colour agreeable unto its myſtery; according to that of Auſten, Significeat mare illud rubrem B 1ptiſ- wm Chriſti ; unde nobis Baptiſmus Chriſti niſs ſunguine Chriſti conſe- fY abs 2
Butdivers Modernes not conſidering theſe conceptions, and appea- ling unto the Teſtimony of ſenſe, have at laſt determined the point; concluding a rednefſe herein, but not in the ſenſe received. Sir Walter Raleigh from his owne and Portugall obſeryations,doth place the red-

nefle of this Seca, in the reflexion from red Iſlands, and the rednefſe of the earth at the bottome , wherein Corall grows very plentifully, and from whence in greatabundance it is tranſported into Europe ; the ob- ſcrvations of Alberquerque, and Stephanue de Gama, as from Johannes de Barros, Fernandins deCordovs relateth, derive this rednefle from the colour of the ſand and argillous earth at the bottomes for being a ſhal- low Sea, while it roulethto and fro , there appeareth a rednefſe upon the water, which is moſt diſcernible in ſunny and windie weather. But that this is no more then an apparent rednefle, he confirmeth by an ex- periment : for inthe reddeſt part taking up a veſlell of water, it differed not from the complexion of other Seas; nor is this colour diſcoverable in every place of that Sea; for as he alſo obſerveth, in ſome places it is very grecn, inothers white and yellow, according to the colour of the earth or ſand at the botfome. And ſo may Philoſtratus bee made out when he ſaith, this Sea is blue; or Bellonius denying this redneſlce, be- cauſe he beheld not that colour about Sues ; or when Corſalius at the mouth thereof could not diſcover the ſame.
Now although we have enquired the ground of rednefle in this Sea, yet are we not fully ſatisfied; for what is forgot by many, and knowne by few, there is another Red Sea whoſe name we pretend not to wake out from theſe principles z that is, the Perfian Gulph or Bay, which divideth the Arabian ard Perfianſhoare , as Plinie hath deſcri- bed it, Mare rubrum in duos dividuur ſinus, © qui ab Orieme eft Perſicus appeBatar, or as Solinus exprefleth it, 241 ab Oriente eff Perficus appells-
tar,ex 4dverſs unde Arabia eft, Ar abicue,whereto aſſenteth Suidas, Orte»
lius, & many more; and therefore there is no abſurdity in Strabo when |
he delivereth that Tigris and Euphrates doe fall into the Red Sea, and Fernendius de Eordevs , juſtly defendeth his Countriman Seneca in that expreſſion, Et quirenatum prorſwe excipiens diem
Tepidum Rubenti Tigrin immiſcet frets.
Nor hath only the Perſian Sea received the ſame name with the Arabian, but, what is ſtrange,and much confounds the diſtinRion, the name thercof is alſo derived from King Erythrus, who was conceived fo be buried in an 1{land of thisSea,as Dionyſus Afer,Curtius,and Sui- das doe deliver , which were of no leſle probability then theother, if 2$ with the ſame Authors Strabo affir » he was buried neare Ca- ramania bordering upon the Perfian Gulph; and if his tombe was ſeen by Nearchus, it was not ſo likely to be in the Arabian Gulph; for we read that from the River Indus he came unto Alexander at Babylon, ſome few dayes before his death. Now Babylon was ſeated upon the | River Euphrates, which runnes into the Perfian Gulphz and therefore however the Latine expreſſcthitin Strabo, that Nearchus ſuffered } much in the Arabian Sinus , yet is the originall wm; mpoimes, that is
the Gulph of Perſia. | | Sfſ - +

That therefore the Red Sea or Arabian Gulph received its name | from perſonall derivation is but uncertaine, that both the Seas of one name ſhould have one common denominator lefle probable, that one from name, another from colour not incredible; that there is a groſle and materiall rednefle in cither not to be affirmed , that there is an empharticall or apparent redneſſc in one, not well to be denyed,; and this is ſufficient to make good the Allegory of the Chriſtians , and in this diſtinction may we juſtifie the name of the Blacke Sea, given unto | Pontus Euxinus , the name of Xanthus, or the Yellow River of Phry- gia, and the name of Mar Vermeio, or the Red Sea in America.

Cauay. X. Of the Blackneſfſe of Negroes, |
T is evident not only in the generall trame of Nature , that things moſt manifeſt uato ſenſe, have proved obſcure unto the under- ſtanding : Burt even in pioper and appropriate objeats, wherein we affirme the ſenſe cannot erre, the faculties of reaſon moſt often fail us. Thus of colours in generall , under whoſe gloſle and verniſh all things are ſeen, no man hath yet beheld the true nature, or poſitively ſer downe their incontroulable cauſes z which while ſome aſcribe un- to the mixture of the Elements,others to the graduality of opacity and light , they haveleft our endeayours to grope them out by twilight, and by darkneſſe almoſt to diſcover that whoſe exiſtence is evidenc:d by light. The Chymiſts have attempted laudably , reducing their cauſes unto Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury ; and had they made it outſo well in this, as in the objects of ſmell and taſte , their endeavours had been more acceptable : For whereas they reter Sapor unto Salt , and Odor unto Sulphur,they vary much concerning colour;ſome reducing it unto Mercury , ſome to Sulphur, others unto Salt 3 wherein indeed the laſt conceit doth not oppreſle the former , and Salt may carry 8. ſtrong concurrence therein. For beſide the fixed and terreftrious Salt, there is in naturall bodies a S«/ ziter referring unto Sulphur , there is alſo a volatile or Armoniac Salt, retaining unto Mercury ; by which Salts the colours of bodies are ſenfibly qualified, and receive de- grees of luſtre or obſcurity , ſuperficiality or profundity , fixation or volatility.
Theirgeneral or firſt natures being thus obſcure,there will be grea- ter difficulties in their particular diſcoveries; for being farther removed from their ſimplicities they fall into more complexed conſiderations, and fo require a ſubtiler a& of reaſon to diſtinguiſh and call forth their natures.

The firſt was generally received.by the Ancients , eſpecially the heathen, who in obſcurities had no higher recourſe thenNature,as may appeare by a Diſcourſe concerning this point in Strabo : By Ariſtotle ; ems to be implyed, in thoſe Problems which enquire why the Sun makes men blacke, and not the fire £ why it whitens wax, yet blacks theskin? By the word Zthiops it ſelfe, applyed to the memorableſt Nations of Negroes,that is of a burnt or torrid countenance: The fap- cie of the fable infers alſo the Antiquity of the opinion,which detiverh the complexion from the deviation of the Sunne , and the conflagrati- on of all things under Phaeton : But this opinion though generally em- braced,was I perccive rejeRed by Ariſtobulus a very ancient Geogra- pher, as is diſcoyered by Strabo, It hath been doubted by ſeverall mo- derne Writers , particularly by Onclius, but amply and ſatisfactorily diſcuſſed as we know by no man z we ſhall therefore endeavour a full delivery hereof,declaring the grounds of doubt,and reaſons of deniall; which rightly underſtod , may if not overthrow , yet ſhrewdly ſhake the ſecurity of this aſſertion. net >. And firſt, many which countenance the opinion in this reaſon, doe eacitly and upon conſequence overthrow it inanother: For whilſt they make the River to divideand bound the Moores, ſo that on the South-ſide they are blacke, on the other onely tawnie ; they imply 2 ſecret cauſality herein from the ayre, place or River, and ſeem notto derive it from the Sunne ; the of whoſe aRivity are not precipl- touſly abrupted, but gradually proceed to their ceflations.

fervor of the Sunne ; yet doe we not hereby diſcover a principle ſuffi- cient todecide the queſtion concerning other animals,nor doth he that ficmeth the heat makes man blacke , afford a reaſon why other ani- malls inthe ſame habitations maintaine a conſtant and agreeable hae unto thoſe in other parts, as Lions, Elephants, Camels, Swans, Tigers, Eftriges, whichthough in ZEchiopia, ia the diſadvantage of two Sum- mers, and perpendicular rayes of the Sunne , doe yet make good the complexion of their ſpecies , and hold a colourable correſpondence unto thoſe in milder regions. Now did this complexion proceed from heat in man , the ſame would be communicated unto other animalls which equally participate the Influence of the common Agent : For thus itis in the effes of cold in Regions far removed from the Sunne; for therein men arc not only of faire complexions, gray eyed, and of light haire, but many creatures _—_ to the ayre , defleR in extre» 'mity from their naturall colours, from browne,ruſſet and blacke,recei- | ving the Complexion of Winter , and turning perfeR white ; for thus Olaus Magnus relates, that afterthe Autumnall Aquinox, Foxes be- ginto grow white; thus Michovius reporteth, and we want not ocular confirmation,that Hares and Partridges turne white in the Winterzand
but that inſeparable accident of Ariſtotles is ſeparated in many hun- dreds.
Thirdly, if the fervor of the Sunne, or infemperate heat of clime did ſolely occafion this complexion , ſurely a migration or change thereof might cauſe a ſenſible,if not a totall mutationg which notwith- ſtanding experience will not admit: ForNegroes tranſplanted although into cold and flegmaticke habirations continue their hue both inthem- ſelves, and alſo their generations; except they mixe with different complexions, whereby notwithſtanding there only ſucceeds a remiſſi- on of their tinQures, there remaining unto many deſcents,a full ſhadow

Book 6. and ( ommon Errers, partake ofthe ſame hue and complexion, which notwithſtanding they do not; For the Inhabitants of the ſame latirude in Afiaare of a diffe- rent complexion, as are the Inhabitants of Cambogia and Java inſo- much that ſome conceave the Negroe is properly a native pf Africa, and that thoſe places in Aſia inhabited now by Moores, are but the in- truſions of Negroes ariving firft from Africa,as we generally conceave of Madagaſcar, and the adjoyning Iſlands, who retaine the ſame com- plexion unto this day. But this deteR is more remarkable in America, which alchough ſubjeRed unto both the Tropicks, yet are not the In- habitants black betweene , or neere, or under either , neither to the Southward in Brafilia, Chili, or Peru, nor yet to the Northward in Hiſpaniola, Caſtilia, del Oro, or Nicaraguava, and although in many parts thereof it be confeſſed there bee at preſent ſwarmes of Negroes ſcrving ufider the Spaniard, yet were they all tranſported from Afti- ca, fince the diſcovery of Columbus, and are not indigenous orgroper natives of America.
Fifthly, we cannot conclude this complexion in Nations fromthe
Negroes under the Southerne Tropick, but are not all of this hue
ander or neerethe Northerne, So the people of Gualata, Agades, Ga- ramantes, and of Goaga, all within the Northerne Tropicks are npt Negroes, but on the other ſide about Capo Negro, Cefala, and Ma-
dagaſcar, they are of a Jetty black. Now if to ſalve this Anomaly wee ſay the heate of the Sun is more powerfull in the Southerne Tropick ,. becauſe in the figne of Capri- corne falls out the Perigeum or loweſt place of the Sunin his Excen- trick, whereby he becomes neerer unto them then unto the other in Cancer, wee ſhall not abſolye the doubt, And if any infiſt upon ſuch nicities, and will preſume a different effeR of the Sun, from ſuch a dit- ference of place or vicinity , we ſhall ballancethe ſame with the con- cernment of its motion , and time of revolution , and ſay he is more powerfull in the Northetne hemiſphere , and in the Apogeum ; for therein his motion is ſlower, and ſo his heate reſpeRively unto thoſe habitarions, as of duration ſo alſo of more effe&. For, though he ab- ſolve his revolution in 365. dayes, odde howres and minutes , yet by reaſon of his Excentricity, his motion is unequall, and his courſe farre longer in the Northerne ſemicircle, then in the Southerne ; for the lat- ter he paſſeth in 178. dayes,but the other takes him 2 $7. that is, eleven dayes more; fo is his preſence more continued unto the Northerne lohabitant, and the longeſt day in Cancer is longer unto us , then that in Capricorne unto the Southerne habitator. Beſide, hereby we onely iferre an inequality of heate in different Tropicks, but not an equality of effeRs in other parts ſubjected to the ſame , For, in the ſame degree, and as neere the carth he makes his revolution unto the American,

whoſe Inhabitants notwithſtanding partake not of the ſame effeR. And if herein we ſeek a reliefe from the Dogſtarre, we ſhall introduce an effe proper unto a few,from a cauſe common unto many,for upon the ſame grounds that Starre ſhould have as forcible a power upon A- merica and Afia, and although it be not verticall unto any part of Afia, but onely paſſeth by Beach, #n terry incognite, yet is it ſounto Ameri- ca, and vertically paſſeth over the habitations of Peru and Braſilia.
Sixtly, and which is very conſiderable, there are Negroes in Africa
the Southerne Tropick, and ſome ſo far removed from it, as Geographically the clime is not intemperate, that is,neere the cape of good Hope, in 36. of Southerne Latitude, Whereas in the ſame elevation Northward, the Inhabitants of America are faire, and they of Europe in Candy, Sicily,and ſome parts of Spaine deſerye not pro- perly ſo low a name as Tawny.
Laſtly , whereas the Africans are conceaved to be more peculiarly ſcorched and torrified from the Sun, by addition of drineſſe from the ſoyle, from want and defeR of water, it will not excuſe the doubt. For the parts which the Negroes poſleſſe,are not ſo void of Rivers and moiſture, as is herein preſumed ; for on the other ſide the mountaines of the Moone, inthat great traR called Zanzibar, there are the mighty Rivers of Suama, and Spirits Saxto ; on this (ide, the great River Zaire, the mighty Nile and Niger, which doe not onely moyſten, and con- temperate the ayre by their exhalations, but refreſh and humeRate the earth by their annuall inundations. Beſfide,in that part of Africa,which with all diſadvantage is moſt dry, that is,in fite betweene the Tropicks, defeR of Rivers and inundations, as alſo abundance of ſands, the peo- ple are not eſteemed Negroes z and that is Lybia, which with the Greeks carries the name of all Africa, A region ſo deſert, dry and ſandy, that travellers (as Leo reports) are faine to carry water on their Camels, whereof they finde not a drop ſometime in 6. or 7. dayes; yet is this Countrey accounted by Geographers no part of terra Nigrits- rum,and Pcolomy placeth herein the Lewco A1hiopes,or pale and Taw- ney Moores.
Now the ground of this opinion might bee the viſible quality of Blackneſſe obſervably produced by heate, fire, and ſmoake ; but eſpe- cially with the Ancients the violent eſteeme they held of the heate of the Sun, in the hot or torrid Zone ; conceaving that part unhabitable, and therefore that people in the vicinities or frontiers thereof , could not eſcape without this change of their complexions. But how farre they were miſtaken in this apprehenſion , moderne Geography hath diſcovered : And as wee have declared , there are many within this Lone whoſe complexions deſcend not ſo low as blacknefle. And if we ſhould ſtrialy infiſt hereon, the poſſibility might fall into fome que- ſtion ; that is, whether the heate of the Sun, whoſe feryor may ſwarte

a living part, and cven black a dead or diflolving fl:th, can yer in ani- mals whoſe parts are ſucceſſive and in continuall lux, produce this deepe and perfe& glofſe of Blacknefle.
Thus having evinced at leaſt made dubious, the Sunne is not the Author of this blacknefic, how and when this tinRure firſt began is yet a Riddle, and poſitively to determine it ſurpaſſerth my preſumprti- on. Seeing therefore we cannot certainly diſcover what did effe& it, it may afford ſome piece of ſatisfaRionto know what might procure it : Ic may betheretfore conſidered, whether the inward uſe of certaine waters or fountaines of peculiar operations, might not at firſt produce the effe& in queſtion. For, of the like we have records in ſtory related by Ariſtotle, Strabo, and Pliny, who hath made a colleRion hereof, as of two fountaines in Bxotia,the one making Sheepe white, the other black, of the water of Siberis which made Oxen black, and the like effcR it had alſo upon men, dying not onely the skin, but making their haires black and curled. This was the conceit of Ariſtobulus, who re- ceaved fo little fatisfaRion from the other , or that it might be cauſed by heate, or any kinde of fire, that he conceayed it as reaſonable to im- pute the cffcR unto water.
Secondly , it may be perpended whether it might not fall out the ſame way that Jacobs cattell became ſpeckled , ſpotted and ring- | ſtraked, that is, by the power and efficacy of Imagination; which pro- duceth effeRs in the conception correſpondent unto the phancy ot the Agents ingeneration, and ſometimes affimilates the Idea of the genera- for into a realty inthe thing ingendred. For, hereof there paſſe tor cur- rant many indiſputed examples; ſo in Hippocrates wee reade of one, chat from the view and intention of a picture conceaved a Negroe; And in the hiſtory of Heliodore of a Mooriſh Queene, who upon aſpeRion ofthe picture of Andromeda, conceaved and brought forth a faire one. And thus perhaps might ſome ſay it was at the beginning of this complexion, induced ficſt by Imagination, which having once impreg- nated the ſeed, found afterward concurrent produQions, which were continued by Climes, whoſe conſtitution advantaged the firſt impreſ-
Aldrovand relateth , many opinion that from aſpeRion of the Snow which lycth long in Northerne Regions, and high moſihtaines,
| Hawkes, Kites, Beares, and other creatures become white ; And by
this way Auſtin conceaveth the Devill provided, they never wanted a white ſpotted Oxe in Egypt, for ſuch an one they worſhipped, and called ic Apis. |
Thirdly , it is not indiſputable whether ie might not proceed from ſuch a cauſe and the like foundation of TinRure, as doth the black
Jaundiſe, which meeting with congenerous cauſes might ſetle durable þnquiations, and advance their generations unto that hue, which was
naturally
fon. Thus Plotinus conceaveth white Peacocks firſt came in: Thus as |!

Daturally before but a degree or two below it: And this tranſmiſſion we ſhall the eaſier admit in colour, if we remember the like hath beene effeRed in organicall parts and figures z the Symmetry whereof being caſually or purpoſely perverted , their morboſities have vigorouſly deſcended to their poſterities, and that in durable deformities. This wasthe beginning of Macrophali or people with long heads, whereof Hippocrates, De Aere, Aquis,& Locks, hath cleerely delivered himſelf : Cumprimum editus eft Infans, caput ejus tenelflum manibus eff ingunt, & in lengitud:ne adoleſcere cogant ; hoc inflitutum primun hujuſmodi ntars dedit vitium, ſucceſſu vero tempors in naturam abiit, ut proinde inſtituto nihil amplizs opus eſſet , ſemen enim genitale ex omnibus corpores partibus provenit, ex ſanis quidem ſanum, ex morboſis morboſum : $1 igitur ex ca-
, luis calut, ex cacins cactt, & ex diftortts, us plurimeum, diſtorti gignuntur,
eademg, in ceteris forms valet ratio, quid prohibet cur non ex macrocepha. lis macrocephali gignantur * Thus as Ariſtotle obſerveth , the Deeres of Arginnia had their cares divided , occafioned at firſt by flitting the cares of Deere. Thus have the Chineſes little feete, moſt Negroes great lips and flat noſes, and thus many Spaniards, and mediterranc- an Inhabitants , which are of the race of Barbary Moores, (although after frequent commixture) have not worne out the Camoys noſe unto this day.
Laſtly, if wee muſt ſtill be urged fo particularities, and ſuch as de- clare how and when the ſeede of Adam did fuſt receave this tinQure; wee may ſay that men became blacke in the ſame manner that ſome Foxes, Squirrels, Lions firſt turned of this complexion, whereof there area conſtant ſort in divers Countries z that ſome Chaughes cane to have red legs and bils, that Crowes became pyed , All which mutatt- ons however they began, depend on durable foundations, and ſuch as
may continue for ever. And ifas yet we cannot ſatisfie , but muſt far- |
ther define the cauſe and manner of this mutation ; wee muſt conteſle, in matters of Antiquity , and ſuch as are decided by Hiſtory , if their
Originals and firſt beginnings eſcape a due relation, they fall into great |
obſcurities, and ſuch as future Ages ſeldome reduce unto a reſolution. Thos if you deduQt the Adminiſtration of Angels , and that they di- ſperſed the creatures into all parts after the flood, as they had cevgre-
ed them into Noahs Arke before ; it will be no cafic queſtion to re- olve, how ſeverall ſorts of Animalls were firſt diſperſed into Iflands, and almoſt how any into America. How the venereall contagion be- gan in that part of the earth, ſince hiſtory is ſilent , is not caſily reſol- ved by Philoſophy , For, whereas it is imputed unto Anthropophagy, or the eating of mans fleſh, the cauſe hath beene common unto many other Countries, and there have beene Canibals or men-caters inthe three other parts of the world, if wee credit the relations of Ptolomy, Strabo, and Pliny. And thus, ifthe favourable pen of Moſes had not

And if any will yetinſiſt , and urge the queſtion farther ſtill upon me, I ſhall be enforced unto divers of the like nature,wherein I ſhall receave no greater ſatisfaRion. T ſhall demand how the Camels of Batria came to have two bunches on their backs, whereas the Ca. ' mels of Arabia in all relations have but one? How Oxen in ſome
| Countries began and continue gibbous or bunch back'd 2 what way
choſe many different ſhapes, colours, haires, and natures of Dogs came in « how they of ſome Countries became depilous and without any haire at all, whereas ſome ſorts in exceſſe abound therewith £ How the Indian Hare came to have a long tayle, whereas that part in others attaines no higher then a ſcut ? How the hogs of Illyria which Ariſto- tle ſpeakes of, became to be ſolipedes or wholl hoofed , whereas in all other parts they are biſulcous and deſcribed cloven hoofed by God himſelfe £ All which with many others muſt needs ſeeme c untothoſe, that hold there were but two of the uncleane ſort in
_ and are forced to reduce theſe varicties to unknowne originals ICC.
However therefore this complexion was firſt acquired,it is evident- ly maintained by generation, and by the tinRure of the skin as a ſper- maticall part <4 cr from father untoſon, ſo that they which are ſtrangers contraR it not, and the Natives which tranſmigrate omit it not without commixture, and that after divers generations. And this affeRion (if the ſtory were true) might wonderfully be confirmed, by what Maginusand others relate of the Emperour of Achiopia, or Pre- fter John, who derived from Solomon is not yet deſcended into the hue of his Countrey, but remaines a Mulatto, that is, of a mongrill complexion unto this day. Now although we conceive this blackneſle to be ſeminall, yet are we not of Herodotus conceit, that is, that their ſced is black, an opinion long agoe rejected by Ariſtotle, and fince by ſence and enquiry z his aſſertion againſt the Hiſtorian was probable, that all ſeed was white; that is, without great controverſic in viviparous Animals,and ſuch as have Teſticles,os preparing veſlcls whercin it re- ceiyes a manifeſt dealbation: And not onely inthem, but (for ought I know) in Fiſhes, not abating the ſeed of Plants, whereof though the $kin and covering be black, yet is the ſeed and fruRifying part not ſo: 25 may be obſerved in the ſeeds of Onyons, Pyonie, and Baſil: moſt controvertible it ſeemes, inthe ſpawne of Frogs, and Lobſters, where- of notwithſtanding at the very firſt the ſpawne is white, contraQting by degrees a blackneſſe,anſwerable inthe one unte the colour of the ſhell,

concordantly unto Beroſus, the fragment of Cato de Originibus , ſome things of Halicarnafſeus, Macrobis, and out of themot Leandro and Annius, wee ſhall conceive of the travailes of Cameſe or Cham, wee may introduce a generation of Negroes as high as Italy , which pan | was never culpable of deformity, but hath produced the magnified ex- | amples of beauty.
Secondly, the curſe mentioned in Scripture was not denounced up- on Cham, but Canaan his youngeſt ſon, and the reaſons thereof are divers ; the firſt, from the Jewiſh Tradition, whereby it is conceived, that Canaan made the diſcovery of the nakednefle of Noah, and noti- fied it unto Cham. Secondly, to have curfed Cham had been to curſe all his poſterity, whereof but one was guilty of the fat. And laſtly, he ſpared Cham, becauſe he had bleſſed him before, cap.9. Now if we confine this curſe unto Canaan, and thinke the ſame tulfilled in his poſterity, then do we induce this complexion on the Sidonians, then was the promiſed land a tra ofNegroes ; For from Canaan were dil- cended the Canaanites, Jebuſites, Amorites, Gerpezites, and Hevites, which were poſſeſſed of that Land.
Thirdly, although we ſhould place the originall of this curſe upon one of the ſons of Cham, yet were it not knowne from which of them to derive it. For the particularity of their diſcents is imperfeRly ſet downe by accountants , nor is it diſtinaly determinable from whom thereof the Athiopians are proceeded. For, whereas theſe of Africa | are generally eftecmed to be the Iſſue of Chus,the elder ſon of Cham,

it is not ſo eaſily made out. For the land of Chus, which the Septuar gint tranſlates A thiopia, makes no part of Africa, nor is it the habita- tion of Blackmores, but the countrie of Arabia, eſpecially the Happy, and ſtony ; poſſeſſions and Colonies of all the ſons of Chus, excepting Nimrod, and Havilah, poflefſed and planted wholly by the children of Chus, thatis, by Sabtah and Raamah, Sabtacha, and the ſons of Raa- mah, Dedan and Sheba, according unto whoſe names the Nations of thoſe parts have received their denominations , as may bee colleRed from Pliny and Pcolomy z, and as wee are informed by credible Au- thors, they hold a faire Analogie in their names , even unto our dayes.

So the wife of Moſes tranſlated in Scripturean &rhiopian, and ſo con- firmed by the fabulous relation of Joſephus, was none of the daughters of Africa, nor any Negroe of &thiepia, but the daughter of Jethro, Prince and Prieſt of Madian, which was a part of Arabia the ſtony, bordering uponthe Red Sea. So the Queene of Sheba came not unto
Solomon out of Achiopia, but from Arabia , and that part thereof which bore the name of the firſt planter thereof, the ſon of Chus. So whether the Eunuch which Philip the Deacon baptiſed , were ſervant unto Candace Queene ofthe African Ethiopia, (although Damianus 4 Goes, Codignus, and the Athiopick relations averre) 15 yet by ma- ny, and with ſtrong ſuſpicions doubted. So that Army of a million, which Zerah King of Athiopiais ſaid to bring againſt Aſa, was drawn |
the remote habitations of the Moores ; For it is ſaid that Aſa purſuing his viRory, tooke from him the city Gerar ; now Gerar was nocityin or neere Athiopia,but a place betweene Cadeſh and Zur, where Abra- ham formerly ſojourned. Since therefore theſe African Mthiopians, are not convinced by the common acceptionto be the ſons of Chus, whether they be not the poſterity of Phut, or Mizraim, or both, it is ot afſuredly determined ; For Mizraim, he poſſeſſed Egypt, and the Eaſt parts of Africa : From Ludym his ſon came the Lybians, and per- haps from them the Arhiopians : Phut poſſeſſed Mauritania, and the Weſterne parts of Africa, & from theſe perhaps deſcended the Moors of the Welt, of Mandinga, Meleguette and Guinic. But from Canaan, upon whom the curſe was pronounced , none of theſe had their origi- nall, for he was reſtrained urito Canaan and Syria z although in after Apes many Colonies diſperſed , and ſomethereof upon the coaſts of Africa, and the prepoſſeſſions of his elder brothers. | Fourthly, totake away all doubt or any probable divarication, the curſe is plainely ſpecified inthe Text, nor need we diſpute it , like the marke of Cain; Serves ſervorum erit fratribus ſuis, Curled be Canaan, a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren, which was after ful- filled inthe conqueſt of Canaan, ſubdued by the [{raclites, the poſte-

oath of his ſervant not to take a wife for his Son Iſaac out of the daugh- ters of the Canaanites 3 And the like was performed by Ifaac inthe behalfe of his ſon Jacob. As for Cham and his other ſons this curſe at- rained them not, for Nimrod the ſon of Chus ſet up his kingdome in Babylon, and ereQed the firſt great Empire, Mizraim and his poſterity grew mighty Monarches in Agyptz and the Empire of the Athiopi- ans hath beene as large as either.
Laſtly , whereas men affirme this colour was a Curſe, I cannot make out the propriety of that name, it neither ſeeming ſo to them, nor reaſonably unto us, for they take ſo much content therein, that they eſteeme deformity by other colours , deſcribing the Dcvill , and ter- rible objets Whice. And if wee ſcriouſly conſult che definitions of beauty , and exaRly perpend what wiſe men determine thereof, wee ſhall not reaſonably apprehend a curſe, or any deformity therein. For firſt, ſome place the eſſence thereof in the praportion of parts, concei-
ofthe beſt and learned Writers : and whereby the Moores are not cx-
of colours , but an apt connexion and frame of parts and the whole.
|
|
Others there be, and thoſe moſt in number, which place it not onely in proportion of parts, but alſo in grace of colour 5 But to make Colour eflentiall unto Beauty, there will ariſe no ſlender difficulty ; For, Ari- ſotle in two definitions of pulchritude, and Galen in one, have made no mention of colour : Neither will it agree unto the Beauty of Ani- mals,wherein notwithſtanding there is an approved pulchritude. Thus horſes are handſome under any colour, and the ſymmetry of parts ob- ſcures the conſideration of complexions; Thus in concolour animals and ſuch as are confined unto one colour wee meaſure nottheir Beauty thereby ; for if a Crowor Black-bird grow white, wee generally ac- counted it more pretty, And even in monſtrofity deſcend not to opini- on of deformity. And by this way likewiſe the Moores cicape the curſe of deformity, there concurring no ſtationary colour, and fome-. times not any unto Beauty.
The Platonick contemplators rejeR both theſe deſcriptions founded upon parts and coloars, or either, as M. Leo the Jew hath excellently diſcourſed in his Genealogy of Love, defining Beauty a formall grace, which delights and moves them to love which comprehend it. This grace ſay they, diſcoverable outwardly, is the reſplendor and Raye of
of compoſitions amiable, whoſe faculties if they can aptly contrive their matter, they in the ſubjeR an agreeable and plcafing beau- ty, if overruled thereby, they evidence not their perfeRions, but runne into deformity. For ſeeing that out of the ſame materials , Therſites

Thus Homer to ( off Minerva h her

Certainly this isa courſe more deſperate then Antipathies, Sympathies or occult quali- ties 3 wherein by a finall and ſatisfaRive diſcernment of faich , we lay the laft and particular effeRts upon the firſt and generall cauſe of all things , whereas in the other wee doe but palliate our determinations, untill our advanced endeavors doe totally rejeR or partially ſalve their cvaſions.
C HAPs, XI | e A digreſſion conterning Blackpeſſe.
Hue being therefore two opinions repugnant unto each other , it may not be preſumptive or skepticall in me to doubt of both , and becauſe we remaine imperteR in the generall theory of Colours, wee ſhall deliver at preſent a ſhort diſcovery of blacknes, wherein although perhaps we afford no greater ſatisfaRion then others, yet ſhall our at- rempt$exceed any ; for wee ſhall emperically and ſenſibly diſcourſe hereof, deducing the cauſcs of Blacknefle from ſuch originalls in Na- cure, as we doe generally obſerve things arc denigrated by Art : And herein I hope our progrefſion will not be thought unreaſonable; For Art being the imitation of Nature, or Nature at the ſecond hand it is but a ſenfible expreſſion of cffeRs dependant on the ſame , through more removed cauſes, and thereforethe works of the one, muſt prove reaſonable diſcoverers of the other.
And firſt, things become blacke by a ſootiſh and fuliginous matter preceeding from the ſulphur of bodies torrified, not taking fulzgo ſtrif- ly, but in oppofition unto «1s, that is any kind of vaporous or madefy- ing excretion, and comprehending «1<2j4«06, that is as Ariſtotle de- fines it,a ſeparation of moiſt and dry parts made by the aQion of heat or fire, & colouring bodies objeRed. Hereof,in his Meteors, from the qua- lities of the ſubjeR he raiſeth three kinds; the exhalations from ligneous and lean bodies, as bones, hair,and the like he calleth *49» famws;trom fat bodies,and fuch as have not their fatneſſe conſpicuous or ſeparated, he tearmeth a2-»»s fuligs, as waxe, rofin, pitch,or turpentine; that from unduous bodies, and ſuch whoſe oylinefle is evident, henameth wie= or wider, now every one of thele doe blacke the bodies objeRed unto them , and are to be conceived in the footy and fuliginous matter

oily fat and unRuous parts wherein conſiſt the principles of Aamma- bility; not pure and refined ſulphur, as inthe ſpirits of wine often reRi- fied, but containing terreſtrious parts, and carrying with it the volatile ſalt of the body,and ſuch as isdiſtinguiſhable by taſte in ſoot; nor vulgar and uſuall ſulphur , for that leaves none or very little blackneſſe , ex- cept a metalline body receive the exhalation,
I fay, torrified, findged, or ſuffering ſome impreſſion from fire, thus are bodies caſually or artificially denigrated , which in their naturalls are of another complexion;thus are Charcoales made black by an infe- Rion of their own ſuffitus;ſo is it true what is affirmed of combuſtible bodies, Aduſta nigra, peruſta albs, black at firſt from the fuliginous tin- Qure , which beingexhaled they become white , as is perceptible in aſhes. And ſo doth fire cleanſe and purifie bodies, becaule it conſumes the ſulphureous parts, which before did make them foule, and there- fore refines thoſe bodies which will never bee mundified by water. Thus Camphire of a white ſubſtance, by its fuligo affordeth a deepe black. So is pitch blacke, although it proceed from the ſame tree with rozen, the one diſtilling forth, the other forced by fire, ſo of the ſuffi- tus of a torch, doe Painters make a velvet blacke ; ſois lampe blacke made; ſo of burnt Harts horn a ſable; ſo is Bacon denigrated in Chim- neyes : ſoin fevers and hot diſtempers from choler aduſt is cauſed a blackneſle in our tongues, teeth and excretions : ſo are uſtilago, brant corne and trees blacke by blaſting, ſo parts cauterized,ganprenated, fi- derated and mortified, become black, the radicall moiſture, or vitall | ſulphur ſuffering an extinRion, and ſmothered in the part affeted. So
not only aRuall but potentiall fire, nor burning fire, but alſo corroding | water will induce a blacknes.So areChimneyes and furnaces generally blacke,cxcept they receive a cleareand manifeſt ſulphursfor the ſinoak of ſulphur will not blacke a paper, and is commonly uſed by women to whiten Tiffanies ; which it performeth by an acide vitriolous, and penetrating ſpirit aſcending from it , by reaſon whereot it is not apt to kindle any thing, norwill it efily light a candle, untill that ſpirit bee ſpent, and the flame approacheth the match : And this is that acide and piercing ſpirit which with ſuch aRivity and compunRion invadeth the braines and noftrills of thoſe that receive it. And thus when Bel- | lonius affirmeth that Charcoales, made out of the wood of Oxycedar are white, Dr. Jordan in hisjudicious Diſcourſe of minerall waters yeeldeth the reaſon, becauſe their yapours are rather ſulphureous then of any other combuſtible ſubſtance. So we ſee that Tinby coals will not blacke linnen being hanged in the {moakethereof, but rather whi- ten it,by reaſon of the drying and penetrating quality of ſulphur, which will make red Roſes white : And therefore to conceive 2 genera blackneſſe in Hell , and yettherein the materiall flames of ſulphur , 15 [90 Philoſophical conception, nor will it conſiſt with the reall effects of its nature.

Enguiries into Vulgar Book. 6.| E Theſe are the advenient and artificiall wayesof denigration, anſwe- rably whereto may be the natural progreſle: Theſe are the waics wher- by culinary and common fires doe operate, and correſpondent here-
unto may be the cffeRs of fire elemental]. So may Bitumen, coals, |
Jet, blacke lead, and divers minerall earths become black; being cither tuliginous concretions in the earth , or ſuffering a ſcortch from deni-
grating principles in their formation: So Iron(as Metalliſts expreſſe it) |
conſiſting of impure Mercury and combuſt ſulphur, becomes of a darke and fad complexion, whereas other metalls have a vivacity and quickneſſe in aſpeRt. So men and other animalls receive different tin- ures from conſtitution and complexionall efloreſcences,and deſcend ſtill lower, as they partake of the fuliginous and denigrating humor. , And fo may the Xchiopians or Negroes become coal-blacke from fuliginous cfloreſcences and complexionall tinRures ariſing from ſuch probabilities, as we have declared before.
The ſecond way whereby bodies become blacke , is an Atramen- rous condition or mixture, that isa vitriolate or copperoſe quality con- joyning with a terreſtrious and aſtringent humidity, for ſo 1s 4tramen- tum ſcriptoriums, or writing Inke commonly made , by copperoſe caſt upon a decoQion or infuſion of galls, I ſay, a vitriolous or copperous
uality ; for vitrioll is the ative or chiefe ingredient in Inke, and no other ſaltthat I know will ſtrike the colour with galles; neither Alom, Sal-gemme, Nitre, nor Armoniack : now artificiall copperoſe, and ſuch as we commonly uſe, is a rongh and acrimonious kinde of falt drawne out of ferreous and eruginous earths, partaking chiefly of | | Tron and Copper, the blew of copper, the green moſt of Iron : Nor is
it unuſuallto diſſolve fragments of Icon in the liquor thereof , for ad- vantage inthe concretion. I ſay, a terreſtrious or aſtringent humidity; for without this there will enſue no tinRure; for copperoſe in a deco- Rion of Lettuce or Mallows affords no black, which with an aſtringent mixture it will doe, though it be made up with oyleas inprinting and painting Inke : But whereas inthis compoſition wee uſe onely Nut- galles, that is an excreſcence from the Oake , therein we follow and beat upon the old receit; forany plant of auſtere and ſtipticke parts will ſuffice,as I have experimented inBiſtorte, Myrobolaus,MyrtasBraban- tica, Balauſtium,and Red-roſes : and indeed,moſt decoRtions of aſtrin- gent plants, of what colour ſoeyer, doe leave in the liquor a deep and Muſcadine red , which by additionof vitrioll deſcend intoa blacke : And ſo Dioſcorides in his receit of Inke,leaves out gall, and with cop- peroſe makes uſc of ſoot.
Now it we inquire in what part of vitriol this Atramentall and de. nigrating cendition lodgeth, it will ſceme eſpecially tolye in the fixed ſalt thereof ; For the phlegme or aqueous evaporation will not de- nigrate, nor yet ſpirits of vitriol , which carry with them volatile and

nimbler Salt : For if upon a decoction of Copperoſe and gall,be pow-
red the ſpirits or oyl of vitriol,the liquor will relinquiſh his Blacknes, the gall and parts of the copperole precipitate unto the hottom,and the Inke grow cleare again , which indeed it will not ſo cafily doe in com- mon Inke , becauſe that nn is diflolyed therein , which hinde- reth the ſeparation : But Colcothar or vitriol burne,though unto a red- neſſe containing the fixed ſalt , will make good Inke , and ſo will the - | Lixivium, or Lye made thereof with warme water ; but the Terre or inſipide earth remaining , affords no blacke at all, but ſeryes in many things for a groſle and uſcfull red.
And if we yet make a more exaQ enquiry , by what this ſalt of vi- trio] more peculiarly gives this colour , we ſhall finde it to be from a metalline condition, and eſpecially anlron property or ferreous partici- pation : For blew Copperoſe which deeply partakes of the copper will doe it but weakly z Verdigriſe which is made out of copper will not doe it at all ; But che filings of Iron infuſed in vinegar, will with a de- coion of galles make good Inke, without any copperoſe at all , and ſo will infufion of Loadſtone, which is of affinity with Iron, and | though more conſpicuouſly inIron, yet ſuch a Calcanthous or Atra- mentous quality, we will not wholly reje& in other metalls, whereby we often obſerve blacke tinQures in their ſolutions. Thus a Lemmon, Quince, or Apple cut with a knife becomes. immediatly blacke: And fo from thelike cauſe, Artichokes, ſo ſublimate beat up with whites of Egges, iftouched witha knife becomes incontinently black. So Aqus Forts , whoſe ingredient is vitriol will make white bodics blacke, So Leather dreſſed with the barke of Oake, is cafily made blacke by a bare ſolution of copperoſe. So divers Minerall waters and ſuch as participate of Iron,upon an inſuſion of become of a dark colour, and entring upon black.So ſteele infuſed, makes not only the li- quor duskie, but in bodies wherein it concurs with proportionable tin- ures makes alſothe excretions black. And ſoalſo trom this vitriolous quality Aercaries daicis, and vitriol vomitive occafion black cjeRions.
Such a condition there is naturally in ſome living creatures. Thus that blacke humor by Ariſtotle named 9», and commonly tranſlated Airamentam my be occafipned in theCartle. Such a condition there is naturally in ſome plants,asBlack- berries, Walnut rinds,Black- cherries, whereby they extivguiſh inflamations. corroborate the ſtomacke, and are eſteemed, ſpecificall inthe Epilepſie. Such an Atramentous con- ditionthere is to bee found ſometime inthe bloud , when that which ſomecall Acetum , others vitriolum , concurs with parts pr for this tioRure... And ſo from theſe conditions the Moores might poſſibly become Negroes, receiving Atramentous impreſfionsin ſome of thole wayes, whoſe poſſibility is by us declared. -

So Cinaber becoities red by the acide exhalation of ſulphur , which otherwiſe preſents a pute and niycous white. So ſpiries of Salt upon a blew paper make an orient red. So Tartar or vi. | triol upon an infuſion of violets affords a delightfull crimſon.

So when trom a basketof Summer fruics,or Apples, as the Vulgar rendreththem, God by Amos foretold the de- ruRion of his people, we cannot ſay they had any reference unto the fruit of Paradiſe which was the deſtruRion of man; but thereby is de- clarcd the propinquity of their deſolation, and tht their tranquility was of no longer duration then thoſe horary and ſoon decaying fruits of Summer ; nor when it is ſaid in the ſame Tranſlation, Pows deſiderit anime ine diſceſſerunt 4 te, the Apples that thy ſoul luſted after are de- | Apoc.14 | parted from thee,js there any alluſion therin unto the fruit of Paradiſe? but thereby is threatned unto Babylon, that the pleaſures and delights | of their palate ſhould forſake them : - and we read in Pierius, that an Apple was the Hicroglyphicke of Love , and that the Statua of Venus | | was made with one in her hand. | Sincetherefore after this fruit curioſity fruiclefleſly enquireth , and | | confidence blindly determineth, we ſhall ſurceaſe our Inquiſt:ion, ra-| ther troubled that it was taſted, then troubling ourſelves in i:sdecifion; this only we obſerve, when things are left uncertaine men will aſſure thera by determination; which 1s not only verified concerning the fruit but the Serpent that perſwaded ; many defining the kinde or ſpe- cies thereof.

or mutilate the Integrity of Adam, preventively conceive the creation
of thirteene ribs. Bur this will not conſiſt with reaſon or inſpeRion : for if wee ſurvey the Sceleton of both ſexes, and therein the compage of bones, wee ſhall readily diſcover that men and women have foure and twenty ribs, that is, twelve on each fide, ſeven greater annexed unto the Sternon, and five leſſer which come ſhort thereof, wherein if it ſometimes hap- penthat either ſex exceed , the conformation is irregular defleRing from the common rate or number, and no more inferrible upon man- kinde, then the monſtroſity of the ſon of Rapha, or the vicious exceſle in the number of fingers and toes : and although ſome difference there be in figure, and the female os inominatums be ſomewhat more protu- berant, to make a fayrer cavity for the Infant, the coccyx ſometime more reflected to give the eaſier delivery, and the ribs themſelyes ſeeme a little flatter , yet are they equall in number. And therefore, : while Ariſtotle doubteth the relations made of Nations which had but ſeven ribs on a fide, and yet delivercth that men have generally no more then eight ; as he rejeceth their hiſtory, fo can we not accept of : his Anatomy.
Aegaine, although we concede there wanted one1ibin the Sceleton of Adam, yet were it repugnant unto reaſon and common obſervation

And to ſpeake more ſttialy, parts of the ſeed do ſeeme to containe the Idea and powet of the whole ; ſo parents deprived of hands, beget manuall iſſves, afid the defeR of thoſe parts is ſupplyed by the Idea of others. So in one graine of corne appearing ſimilary and inſufficient for a plu- rall germination, there lyeth dormant the virtuality of many other, and from thence ſometimes proceed an hundred eares: and thus may bee made out the cauſe of multipareus produQions, for though the ſemi- nall materialls diſperſe and ſeparate inthe matrix, the formative ope- rator will not delineat a part , but endeavour the formation of the whole , effeQing the ſame as farre as the matter will permit. and from devided materials attempt entire formations. And therefore, though wondrous ſtrange, it may not be impoſſible what is confirmed at Lauſ- dun concerning the Counteſſe of Holland, nor what Albertus reports of the birth of an hundred and fifty, and if we conſider the 'magnalities of Generation in ſome things , wee ſtall not controvert its poſſibilities in others, nor eaſily queſtion that great worke, whoſe wonders are onely ſecond unto thoſe of the Creation, and a cloſe apprehenſion of the one , might perhaps afford a glimmering light , crepuſculous glance of the other *

thoſe which are left in filence by Moſes , for neither is the age of Abel expreſſed in the Scripture , yet is he conceived farre elder then com- monly is opinion'd: and if wee beleeve the concluſion of his Epitaph as made by Adam, and fo ſet downe by Salian, Poſuit warens pater cud 4 filio juſflius poſituns foret , Anne ab orturerum 130. ab Abele nat 119. we ſhall not need to doubt; which notwithſtanding Cajetap and o- thers confirme z nor is it improbable, if wee conceive that Abel was borne in the ſecond yeare of Adam, and Setha yeare after the death of Abel : for ſo it being ſaid,that Adam was an hundred and thirty yeares old when he begat Seth, Abel muſt periſh the yeare before , which was one hundred twenty nine.
And if the account of Cain extend unto the Deluge, it may not bee improbable, that ſome thereof exceeded any of Seth : nor is it unlike- ly in life, riches , power and temporal bleſſings, they might ſurpaſle

the ſeed of Jacob was under afflition and captivity, that of Iſmael and Eſau flouriſhed and grew mighty, there proceeding from the one twelve Princes, from the other , no leflſe then fourcteene Dukes and eight Kings. And whereas the age of Cainand his poſterity is not de- livered inthe Text, ſome doe ſalve it from the ſecret method of Scri- ptuie, which ſometimes wholly omits, but ſeldome or never delivers
the entire duration of wicked and faithlefle perſons ; as is obſervable |
inthe hiſtory of Eſau, and the Kings of Iſrael and Judah. And there- fore, that mention is made that Iſmael lived 1137. yeares,ſome conceive he adhered untothe faith of Abraham; for ſo did others who were not deſcended from Jacob, for Job is thought to be an Idumean, and of the ſced of Eſau, |

And therefore, to conceive there was no Rainebow before, becauſe God choſe this out asa token of the Covenant, isto conclude the exiſtence of things from their ſignalities, or of what is objected unto the ſence , a coexi- ſtence with that which is internally preſented unto the underſtanding.

But Rainebowes are ſeene unto all the world, and every poſicion of ſphere ; unto our owne Elevation it my appeare in the morning while the Sunne hath atfained about forty five degrees a- bove the Horizon, (which is conceived the larpeſt ſemidiameter of any Iris ) and ſoin the afternoone when it hath declined unto that al- tiende againe ; which height the Sun not attaining in winter , Raine- bowes may happen with us at noone or any time. Ulnto a right po- fition of ſpheare it may appeare three howres after the tifing of the Sun , and three before its ſetting ; for the Sun aſcending fifteene de- | grees an houre, in three attaineth forty five of altitude.

Now whereas the Scripture affordeth the priority of order unto Sem , we cannot from thence inferre his primogeniturez for in Sem the holy line was continued, and therefore however borne , his genealogy was moſt remarkeable. So is it not unuſuall in holy Scri- pture to nominate the younger before the elder ; ſo is it ſaid, That Ta- rah begat Abraham, Nachor, and Haram z whereas Haram was the eldeſt. So Rebecca is termed the mother of Jacob and Eſau. Nor is it ſtrange the younger ſhould be firft in nomination, who have com- monly had the priority inthe bleſſings of God,and been firſt in his be-

Cuayr, VIL Of the Mandrakes of Leah.
VVE E ſhall not omit the Mandrakes of Leah, according to the Hiſtory of Genefis. And Reuben went out inthe dayes of Wheat-harveſt and found Mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah , then Rachel ſaid unto Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy ſonnes Mandrakes, and ſhe ſaid unto her, Is it a ſmall mat-
rer that thou haſt taken my husband , and wouldeſt thou take my ſons Mandrakes alſo 2 and Rachel ſaid, therefore he ſhall lye with thee this night forthy ſonnes Mandrakes ; from whence hath ariſen a com- mon conceit , that Rachel requeſted theſe plants as a medicine of fe- cundation, or whereby ſhe might become fruitfull ; which notwith- ſtanding is very queſtionable, and of incertaine truth.
For firſt from the compariſon of one Text with another , whether che Mandrakes here mentioned , be the ſame plant which holds that name with us there is ſome cauſe to doubt; the word is uſed in another place of Scripture , when the Church inviting her beloved into the fields, among the delightfull fruits of Grapes and Pomegranats, itis ſaid , the Mandrakes givea ſmell , and at our gates are all manner of pleaſant fruits. Now inſtead of a ſmell of delight, our Mandrakes af- ford a papaverous and unpleaſant odour, whether in the leafe or apple 25 is diſcoverable in their ſimplicity or mixture ; the ſame is alſo dubi- ous from the different interpretations : for though the Septuagint and Joſepbus doe render it the Apples of Mandrakes in this Text yet inthe other of the Canticles the Chaldy Paraphraſc tearmeth it Balſame. R. Solomon , as Druſius obſerveth , conceives it to be that plant the Arabians named Jeſemin. Oleaſter and Georgians Yenerws the Lilly; and that the word Dudeim , may comprehend any plant that hath a good ſmell, rcſembleth awomans breaſt , and flouriſheth in wheat harveſt ; Junius and Tremellius interpret the ſame for avy amiable flowers of a pleaſant and delightfull odour : but the Geneva Tranfla- tors have been more wary then anyzfof although they retaine the word Mandrake in the Text, they in cffe retraR it in the Margine, wherein is {ct downe, The word inthe originall is Dud&/m,, which is a kinde of fruit or flower unknowne.
Not ſhall we wonder at the diſſent of expoſition, and difficulty of definition concerning this Text , if we perpend how varioufly the ve- getables of Scripture are expounded , and how hatd it is in many pla- ces tO make out the ſpecies determined. Thus arc we at variance cot» cerning the plant that covered Jonas , which though the Septuagint doth render Colocynthis, the Spaniſh Calabaca,and ours accordingly a gourd, yet the vulgar tranſlates it Hedera or Juicc;and,as Grotius ob-

the meane time Leah had three children, Iſachar, Zabulon, and Dinah.
Laſtly, although at that time they failed of this effeR, yet is it main- ly queſtionable whether they had any ſuch vertue either in the opini- ons of thoſe times orin their proper nature;that the opinion was popu- lar in the land of Canaan it is improbable , and had Leah underſtood thus much ſhe would not ſurely have parted with fruits of ſuch a facul- | ty,cſpecially unto Rachel who was no friend unto her. As for its pro- per nature , the Ancients have generally eſteemed it Narcotick or ſtu- pefaQive,and is to be found in the liſt of poyſon ſet downe by Dioſco- rides, Galcn, Acius, A zineta, and ſcverall Antidotes delivered by them againſt it. It was I confefle from good Antiquity , and inthe dayes of Theophraſtus accounted a philtre , or plant that conciliates aficion, and ſo delivered by Dioſcorides; and this intent might ſeem moreprobable, hadthey not been the wives of holy Jacob, had Ra- chel preſcnted them unto him, and not requeſted them for her ſclfe.
Now what Dioſcorides affirmeth in favour of this eftket, that the
| praines of the Apples of Mandrakes mundifie the Matrix and appli-
ed with ſulphur ſtop the fluxes of women, he overthrows by qualities deſtruRive unto conception z affirming alſo that the juice thercof pur- geth upward like Hellebore , and applycd in peflaries provokes the menſt;uous lowes and procures abortion. Perris Hiſpanus, or Pope Joha the twentieth ſpeakes more direRly in his Theſaurus payperum; wherein among the receits of fxcundation, he experimentally com- | mendeth the wine of Mandrakes given with Triphers Magna : but the ſoule of the medicine may lye in Tripher« magne, an excellent compo- ficion , and for this effect commended by Nicolaus. AnJ whercas Levinus Lemnius that eminent Phyſician doth alſo concede this effeR it is from manifeſt cauſes and qualities elementall occaſionally produ- cing the ſame ; for he imputeth the ſame unto the coldneſfc of that ſimple, and is of opinion that in hot climates, and where the uterine parts exceeed in heat, by the coldnefle hereof they may bee reduced into a conceptive conſtitution, and Craſis accommodable unto gene- ration;whereby indeed we will not deny the due and frequent uſe may proceed unto ſome effe&t, from whence notwithſtanding wee cannot ioferre a fertiliating condition or property of fecundation : for in this way all vegetables doe make fruitfull according unto the complexion of the Matrix; if that excell in heat, plants exceeding in cold doe recti- fie it, if it be cold, fimples that are hot reduce it, if dry moiſt, if moiſt dry correR it, in which diviſion all plants are comprehended ; but to

Cuaeye. VIII. Of the three Kings of Collein.
S Common conceit there is of the taree Kings of Callein , concei- ved to be the wiſe men that travelled unto our Saviour by the di- re&ion of the Star, wherein omitting the large Diſcourſes of Baronius, Pineda, and Monfacutius, Thatthey might be Kings, beſide the anci- ent Tradition afd authority of many Fathers , the Scripture alſo im- plycth. The Gentiles ſhall come tothy light,and Kings to the bright- neſſe of thy riſing. The Kings of Tharfis and the Iſles, the Kings of Arabia and Saba ſhall offer gifrs , which places moſt Chriſtians and
ceived potent Monarchs, or mighty Kings, but Toparks, Kings of Cities or narrow territories , ſuch as were the Kings of Sodome and
nality. |
Gomorrah,the Kings of Jericho and Ai, the one and thirty which Jo- ſuah ſubdued , and ſuchas ſome conceive the friends of Job to have been.
But alchough we grant they were Kings, yet can we not bee aſſured they were three : for the Scripture maketh no mention of any number, and the number of their preſents, Gold,Myrrh and Frankinſcence,con- cludeth not thenumber of their perſons; for theſe were the commo-
one perſon had brought before unto Solomon; and ſo did not the ſons of Jacob divide the preſent unt> Joſeph , but are conceived to carry orc for themall, according tothe expreſſion of their father, Take of | the beſt ſruuvs of the land in your veſlells, and carry downe the man a preſerit : and therefore their number being uncertaine,what credit isto begiven unto their names, Gaſpar, Melchior, Balthazar £ what to the charme thereof againſt the falling ſicknefſc? or what unto their h4bits,

certain ſtory, and authenticke pourtraits of Collein, Laſtly,although wegrantthem Kings , and three in number, yet could wee not con- ceivethat they were Kings of Collein. For though Collein were the chiefe City of the Yb#,then called Yb1opo!#,and atterwards Agrippins, yet will no hiſtory informe usthere were three Kings thereof. Beſide -heſe being rulers in their Countries; and returning home would have »robably converted their ſubjcRsz but according unto Munſters re- port , their converſion was not wrought untill ſeventy yeares after by Maternus adiſciple of Peter. And laſtly, it is ſaid chat the wiſe men came from the Eaſt; but Collein is ſeated Weſt-ward from Jeruſalem, for Collein hath of longitude thirty foure degrees , but Jeruſalem ſe- venty two.
The ground of all was this; theſe wiſe men or Kings, were proba-
bly of Arabia, and deſcended from Abraham by Keturah , who ap- prehending the myſtery of chis ſtarre, cither by the Spirit of God, the propheſic of Balaam, the propheſic, which Suetonius mentions, recci- ved and conſtantly believed through all che Eaſt, that out of Jury one ſhould come that ſhould rulethe whole world ; or the divulged cxpe- Qancy of the Jewes from the expiring prediRion of Daniel , were by | the ſame conduRted unto Judea, returned into their Country,and were
after baptiſed by Thomas ; from whence about three hed yeares after, by Helena the Emp:cfle their bodies were tranſlated to Conſtan- tinople, from thence by Euſtathius unto Millane, ard atlaſt by Renz- tus the Biſhop unto Colleinz; where they are belceved at preſent to re- maine, itheir monuments ſhowne unto ſtrangers , and having loſt their Arabian titles, are crowned Kings of Collein. |

A third affirmeth that they were propertly Locuſts, that is a ſheath- winged and fix-footed inſeR, ſuch as is our Graſhopper; and this opi- nion ſeems more probable'then the other : for beſide the authority of Origen, Jerome, Chryſoſtome, Hillary, and Ambroſe to confirme it, this is the proper ſignification of the word , thus uſed in Scripture by the Septuagint, Grecke vocabularies thus expound it ; Suidas on the word Azeis obſerves itto be that animall whereon the Baptiſt fed in the
and ſeverall humane Authors. And laſtly, there is no abſurdity in this interpretation, or any ſolid reaſon why we ſhould decline it; it being a food permitted unto the Jewes, whereof foure kindes are reckoned up among cleane meats. Beſide , not enely the Jewes , but many other Nations long before and fince , have made an uſuall food thereof, That the Athiepians, Mauritanians, and Arabians, did commonly eat them is teſtified by Diodorus, Strabo, Solinus, &lian and Plinicz that they ſtill feed on them is confirmed by Leo, Cadamuſtus and others. John therefore as our Saviour faith, came neither eating nor drinking,
that is farre from the dyet of Jeruſalem and other riotous places; bu fared courſely and poorely according unto the apparrell he wore, that
is of Camells haire; the place of his abode, the wildernefſes and the doctrine he preached, humilation and repentance.

ſhall not eſcape our enquiry. Ir is drawne from the ſpeech of our Savi- our unto Peter after the prediRon of his martyrdomes Peter ſaith un- to Jeſus, Lord,and what ſhall this man do? Teſus ſaith unto him, If 1 will that he tarry untill I come, what is that to thee © follow thou me; then went this ſaying abroad among the brethrenthat this diſciple ſhould not dye.
Now the apprehenſion hereof hath been received either groſlely and inthe generall , that is not diſtinguiſhing the manner or particular way of this continuation, in which ſenſe probably the grofler and un- diſcerning party received it; or more diſtinaly apprehending the man- ner of his immortality z that is , that Iohn ſhould neverproperly dyc, but be tranſlated into Paradiſe, there to remaine with Enoch and Elias untill about the comming of Chriſt , and ſhuuld be ſlaine with them under Antichriſt, according to that of the Apocalyps. I will give po- wer unto my two witneſſes , and they ſhall prophefic a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes cloathed in ſackcloath , and when they
ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimony, the beaſt that aſcendeth our of the
bottomeleſle pit , ſhall make warre againſt them and ſhall overcome chem and kill them. Hereof, as Baronius obſerveth, within three hun- dred yeares after Chriſt, Hippolytus the martyr was the firſt aſſertor, but hath been maintained by many fince, by Metaphraſtes, by Frecul- phus , but eſpecially by Georgius Trapezuntius , who hath expreſly treated upon this Text; and alchough he lived but inthe laſt Centurie, did ſtill affirme that Iohn was not yet dead.
As for the groſſc opinion that he ſhould not dye,it is unto my judge- ment ſufficiently refured by that which firſt occaſioned ir, thar is the Scripture it ſelfe, and no further of, then the very ſubſequent verſe: yet Ieſus ſaid not unto him he ſhould not dye, but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee * and this was writren by Iohn himſclt whom the opinion concerned , and as is conceived many yeares after when Peter had ſuffered, and fulfilled the Prophefie of Chriſt.
For the particular conceit the foundation is weake , nor can it bee made out from the Text alleadged inthe Apocalyps : for beſide that therein two perſons are onely named , no mention is made of Tohn a third ARor inthis Tragedy ; the ſame is overthrowne by Hiſtory, which recordeth not onely the death of Iohn , but affigneth the place of his buriall, that is Epheſus a City in Aſia minor  whither aftcr hee had beene baniſhed into Patmos by Domitian hee returned in the reigne of Nervya there deceaſcd.and was buried in the daycs of Trajan, and this is teſtified by Ierome de Scriptoribus Ecclefpafticis , by Terul- lian de Anime, by Chryſoſtome, and by Euſebius, in whoſe dayes bis Sepulchre was to be ſeen; and by a more ancient Teſtimony allead alſo by him, that is of Polycrates Biſhop of Epheſus, not many fuc- ceſſions after Iohn z whoſe words are theſe in an Epiſtle unto =_—_

Biſhop of Rome, 1ohanres ille qui ſupra petFus Domini recumbebat Do- der optimus apud Epheſum dormrvis; many of the like nature are noted { by Baronius, Janſenius, Eſtius, Lipellous, and others.
| Now the maine and primitive ground of this error , was a grofle ' miſtake in the words of Chriſt, and a falſe apprehenfionof his mea- ning z underſtanding that poſitively which was conditionally expreſ- ſed, orreceiving that affirmatively which was but conceflively delive- red ; forthe words of our Saviour runne ina doubtfull traine, rather reprehending then ſatisfying the curoſiry of Peter, that is, as though he ſhould have ſaid , Thou haſt thine owne doome , why enquireſt thou after thy brothers * what reliefe unto thy afflition will be the ſociety of anothers 2 why pryeftthou intothe ſecrets of Gods judgements ? if he ſtay uatill T come, what concerneth it thee? who ſhalt bee ſure to ſuffer before that time 2 and ſuc> an anſwer probably he returned be- cauſc he foreknew Tohn ſhould not ſuffer a violent death, but goe unto his grave in peace; which had Peter aſſuredly knowne, it might have caſt ſome water 0n his flames, and ſmothered thoſe fires which kindled after unto the honour of his Maſter.
Now why among all the reſt Iohn only eſcaped the death of a Martyr, the reaſon is given z becauſe all other fled away or withdrew themſelves at his death, and he alone of the Twelve beheld his paſſion onthe Croſſe; whereinnotyirhſtanding , the aMi&ion that he ſuffe- red could not amount unto lefle then Martyrdome: for if the naked re- lation, atleaſt the intentive confideration of that paſſion , be able ſtill and at this diſadvantage of time, to rend the hearrs of pious contempla- | {tors ; ſurely the neare and ſenſible viſion thereof muſt needs occation | | aponics beyond the comprehenfion of flcfh, and the trajeRions of ſuch ;' an objeR more ſharpely pierce the martyr'd ſoule of Ioho, then after- | ward did the nayles the crucified body of Peter.
Agpaine, they were miftaken in the Empharticall apprehenſion, pla- cing the confideration upon the words , It I will , whereas it properly | lay intheſe,when I come : which had they apprehended as ſome have fince, that is, not for his ultimate and laſt retarne, but his comming in jud and deſtruction upon the Iewes, or ſuch a comming as it might be ſaid , that that generation ſhould not paſſe before ir was ful- filled : they needed not , much lefle need we ſuppoſe ſuch diuturnityy for aſter the death of Peter , Iohn lived to behold the ſame fulfilled by Veſpafian: nor had he then his Nunc dimitt&, or went out like unto | Simeon, but old in accompliſht obſcuritices,and having ſeen the expire | > Danicls prediRion, as ſome conceive , he accompliſhed his Reve- ation.
But beſides this original, and primary foundation, divers others |

ciples and brethren , which were contemporary unto him, or lived a- bout the ſame time with him; and this was ficſt the extraordinary affe- cionour Saviour bare unto this diſciple , who hath the honour to bee called the diſciple whom Ieſus loved. Now from hence they might be apt to belecve their Maſter would diſpence with his death,or ſuffer him to live to ſee him returne in glory , who was the onely Apoſtle chat beheld him to dye in diſhonour. Another was the belicte and opinion of thoſe times that Chriſt wou!d ſuddenly come; for they held not generally the ſame opinion with their ſucceſſors, or as deſcen- ding ages after ſo many Centuries, but conceived his comming would not be long after his'/paſſion, according unto ſeverall expreſſions of our Saviour groflely underſtood,and as we finde the ſame opinion not lo after reprehended by'St.Paulzand thus conceiving his comming woul not be long, they might be induced to believe his fayonrite ſbould live unto it. Laſtly, the long life of Iohn might much advantage this opi- nion , for he ſurvived the other Twelve, he was 22 yeares when he was called by Chriſt , and 25 that is the age of Prieſthood at his death, and lived 93 yeares, that is 68 after his Saviour, and dyed not before the ſecond yeare of Trajane. Now having outlived all his fel- lows, the world was confirined he might live ſtill, and even unto the comming of his Maſter.
The grounds which promoted it in ſacceeding apes were eſpecially ewo z thethe firſt his eſcapeof Martyrdome': for whereas all the reſt ſuffered ſome kinde of forcible death, we have no hiſtory that he ſuffe- red any ; and men might thinke he was not capable thereof , for ſo, as Hiſtory hath related, by the command of Domitian he was caſt into a Cauldron of burning oyle, and came out againe unfinged. Now fu- ture ages apprehending hee ſuffered no violent death , and finding al- ſo the means that tended thereto could take no place , they might bee confirmed intheir opinion that death had no power over him,and eafi- ly belceve he might live alwayes who could not be deſtroyed by fice, and reſiſt the fury of that Element which nothing ſhall refit, The ſe- cond was a corruption crept into the Latine Text , reading for $7, Sic eu manere vols, whereby the anſwer of otir Saviour becommeth po- fitive, orthat he will have it ſo, which way of reading was. much recet- ved in former apes, and is ſtill retained in the vulgar Tranſlation; but in the Greek & original, the word is i ſignifying Sor if, which is very different from*ws, and cannot bee tranſlated for it : and anſwerable hereunto is the tranſlation of Junius and Tremellius , and that alſo an- nexed unto the Greeke by the authority of Sixtus quintae.
The third confirmed it in farther deſcending, and proved a powerfull argument unto all others following ; that in his combe at Epheſus there was no corps or relique thereof to be found ; where- upon atriſed divers doubts, and many ſuſpitious conceptions, n_ be-

others, that he deſcended alive into his tombe, and from thence depar- tedafter. But all theſe proceeded upon unveritable grounds, as Baro- vius hath obſerved, who alledgeth a letter of Celeſtine Biſhop of Rome, unto the Councell of Epheſus , wherein he declareththe re- liques of John were highly honoured by that City, and a paſſage alſo of Chryſoſtome inthe Homilies of the Apoſtles.

Enquiries into Vulgaor Book7. whether as Joſephus and many maintaine, he ſuffered alſo for not per- forming the commandement of God concerning capitation, that when the people were numbred, for every head they ſhould pay unto God a ſhekell, we ſhall not here contend, Surely, it it were not the occaſi- on of this plague, wee muft acknowledge the omiſſion thereof was, threatned with that puniſhment, according to the words of the Law. When thou takeſt the ſurnme of the children of Iſrael, then ſhall they give every man a ranſome for his ſoule unto the Lord, that there be no plague amongſt them. Now, how deepely hereby God was defrauded in the time of David, and opulent State of Iſrael , will cafily appeare by the ſummes of former luſtrations. For in the firſt,the ſilver of them that were numbred was an hundred Talents, and a thouſand ſeven hundred threeſcore and fifteene ſhekels ; a Bekah for every man, that (is, halfe a ſhcke], after the ſhekel of the SanQuary z for every one from twenty yeares old and upwards, for fix hundred thouſand , and three thouſand and five hundred and fifty men. Anſwerable whereto wee reade in Joſephus, Veſpaſian ordered that every man of the Jews
teenepence, or a quarter of an ounce of filver with us, and is equiva- lent unto a Bekah, or halfe a ſhekell of the SanRuary. For, an Attick dragme is ſeven pence halfe penny , or a quarter of a ſhekell, and a didrachmum or double dragme, 1s the word uſed for Tribute money, or halfe a ſhekell ; and a ſtater the money found inthe fiſhes mouth was two Didrachmums, or an whole ſhekel!l, and tribute ſufficient for | our Saviour and for Peter.

That Abſalon was hanged by the haire of the head, and not caught up by the neck, as Joſephus conceiveth,, and the common argument

with its uoruly and tumultuous motion might afford a beginning unto the common opinion z thus may the expreſſion in Cteſiphon be made out ; and by this may Ariſtotle be interpreted, when in his Problemes he ſeemes to borrow a Metaphor from Euripus ; while in the five and ewentieth ScRion he enquireth , why in the upper parts of houſes the ayre doth Euripize, that 1s, is whirled hither and thither.
Now the ground, orthat which gave life unto the aſſertion, might be his death at Chalcis , the chicfc City of Eubza, and ſeated upon Euripus, where tis confeſſed by all he ended his dayes. That he ema- ciated and pined away inthe too anxious enquirie of its reciprocations, although not drowned therein,as Rhodiginus relateth ſome conceived, was 2 halfe confeſſion thereof not juſtifiable from Antiquity. Surely the Philoſophy of flux and reflux was very imperfeR of old among
| the Greeks and Latins; nor could they hold a ſufficient theory thereof,
who onely obſcrveth the Mediterranean, which in ſome places hath no ebbe, and not much in any part. Nor can we affirme our knowledge is
at the height, who haye now the Theory of the Ocean and narrow Seas |
beſide. While we referre it unto the Moone, we give ſome ſatisfaQi- on for the Ocean, but nogenerall ſalve for Creeks, and Seas which know no floud ; nor reſolve why it flowes three or foure foot at Ve- nice inthe bottome of the Golte, yet ſcarce at all at Ancona Durazzo, or Corcyra, which lye but by the way. And therefore old abſtruſities have cauſed new inventions; and ſome from the Hypotheſes of Co- pernicus or the D:urnall and annuall motion of the earth, endeavour to lalve the owes and motions of theſe ſeas, illuſtrating the fame by wa- ter in a boale, that riſing or falling to either fide, according to the mo- tion of the veſlell ; the conceit is ingenuous, falves ſome doubts , and is diſcovered at large by Galilzo in his Syſteme of the world.
However therefore Ariſtotle died, what was his end, or upon what occaſion, although it be not altogether affured , yet that his memory and worthy name ſhall live, no man will deny , nor gratefull {chollar doubt : and if according to the Elogie of Solon , a man may be onely ſaid to be happy after he is dead, and ceaſcthto be inthe viſible capaci- ty of beatitude : or if according unto his owne Ethicks, ſence is not eſ- {entiall unto felicity, but a man may be happy without che apprehenſi- onthereof; ſurely in that ſence he is pyramidally happy, nor can be ever periſh bat inthe Euripe of Ignorance, or till the Torrent of Barba- riſme overwhelme all.
A like conceit there paſſeth of Meleſigenes, <//a Homer, the father Poet, that he pined away upon the Riddle of the fiſhermen.

Cuayre, XIV,
Of the Wiſh of Philoxenus.
Hat Relation of Ariſtotle ard conceit generally received concer- ning Philoxenus, who wiſhed the neck of a Crane, that thereby he might take more pleaſure in his mear, although ic paſs without excepti- on, upon enquiry I finde not onely doubtfull in the ſtory, but ablurd in the defire or reaſon alledged for it. For though his Wiſh were ſuch as
eating, but rather to obtaine advantage thereby in ſinging, 4s is declared by Mirandula. Ariſtotle (faith he) in his Ethicks and Problemes, accu-
is delivered, yet had it not perhaps that end to delight his guſt in |
ſeth Philoxenus of ſenſuality , for the greater pleaſurcet guſt in deſi- ring the neck of a Crane ; which defire of his, affenting unto Ariſtotle, I have formerly condemned ; Burt fince I perceive that Ariſtorle for this accuſation hath beene accuſed by divers Writers; for Philoxenus was anexcellent Muſician, and deſired the neck of a Crane, not for any pleaſure at meate,, but fancying thereby an advantage in ſinging | or warbling, and deviding the notes in mufick. And indeed , maby Writers there are which mention a Muſigian of that name, as Piurarch | io his booke againſt Ulſury , and Ariſtotle himſelfe in the eight of his | Politicks, ſpeakes of one Philoxenus a Muſician, that went off from the |Dorick Dytherambicks unto the Phrygian Harmony.
Apaine, be the ſtory true or falſe, rightly applicd or not, the inten- tion 1s not reaſonable, and that perhaps neither one way nor the other. For, if we rightly conſider the organ of taſte, we ſhill finde the length of the neck to conduce but little unto it. For the tongue being the in- ſtrument of taſte, and the tipthereof the moſt exaR diſtinguiſher, it will not advantage the guſt co have the neck extended , wherein the Gullerand conveying parts are onely ſeated, which partake not of the nerves of guſtation or appertaining unto ſapor, but receive them onely from the ſixth payrez whereas the nerves of taſte deſcend from the third and forth propagations,and ſo diffuſe themſelves intothe tongue. Andtherefore Cranes, Hecrnes, and Swans, have no adyantage in taſte beyond Hawkes, Kites, and others of ſhorter necks.
Nor, if we conſider it, had Nature reſpe& unto the taſte inthe dif- ferent contrivance ofnecks, bur rather unto the parts contained , the compoſure of the reſt of the body,and the manner whereby they feed. Thus animals of long legs, have generally long necks , that is, for the

unto the earth. So have Horſes, Camels, Dromedaries long necks, and all tall atimals, cxcept the Elephant, who in defet thereof is fur- niſhed with a Truck, without which he could not attaine the ground. So have Cranes, Hernes, Storks, and Shovelards long necks; and ſo even in Man whoſe figure is ere, the length of the neck followeth the proportion of other parts; and ſuch as have round faces, or broad cheſts and ſhoulders,have ſeldome or never long necks. For,the length of the face twice exceedeth that of the neck, and the ſpace betwixt che throat pit and the navell is equall unto the circumference thereof. Againe, animals are framed with long ——_—_— unto the courſe of their life or feeding : ſo many with ſhort legs have long necks, be- cauſe they feed inthe water, as Swans, Geele, Pellicans,and other fin- footed animals. But Hawkes and birds of prey have ſhort necks and truſled legs; for that which is long is weake and flexible, and a ſhorter figure is beſt accommodated unto that intention. Laſtly, the necks of animals doe vary , according to the parts that are contained inthem, | which are the weazon and the gullet. . Such as have no weazon and breathe not , have ſcarce any neck, as moſt ſorts of fiſhes , and ſome none at all, as all ſorts of peRinals, Soales, Thornback, Flounders; and all cruſtaceous animals, as Creviſes, Crabs, and Lobſters.
All which conſidered, the Wiſh of Philoxenus will hardly confiſt with rcaſon. More excuſable had it beene to have wiſhed himſclfe an Ape, which if common conceit ſpeake true, is exaRer in tafte then any. Rather ſome kinde of granivorous bird then a Crane , for in this ſenſe chey are ſo exquiſite, that upon the firſt peck of their bill, they can di- ſtioguiſb the qualities of hard bodies, which the ſence of man diſ- cernes not without maſtication. Rather ſome ruminatiog animall , that he might have cate his meate twice over ; or rather, as Theophilus obſerved in Athenzus, his defire had beene more reaſonable, had hee wiſhed himſclfe an Elephant, or an Horſe; for in theſe animals the appetite is more vehement, and they receive their viapds in large and plentcous manner. And this indeed had beene more ſutable , if this were the ſame Philoxenus whereof Plutarch ipeaketh, who was ſo un- civilly greedy, that to engroſle the mcfle, he would preventively de- liver his noftrils in the diſh.
As for the muficall advantage, although it ſceme more reaſonable, yet doe we not obſervethat Cranes and birds of long necks have any muſicall, but harſh and clangous throats. But birds that are canorous and whoſe notes we moſt commend, arc of little throats , and ſhort necks,as Nightingales, Finches, Linnets, Canary birds and Larkes. And truly, although the weazon , throtle and tongue be the inftruments of yoice, and by their agitations doe chiefly concurre unto theſe delight- full modulations, yet cannot we affigne the cauſe unto any particular formation ; and I perceive the beſt thereof , the Nightingale hath

' | meth, he ſawan Aﬀe with his {addle caſt therein, and drowned. Now
{elfe, but in the cauſe alledged. For, as for the ſtory men deliver it variouſly; ſome I fexre too largely, as Pliny , who affirmeth that bricks will ſwim therein. Mandevill goeth farther , that Iron ſwim- meth, and feathers finke. Munſter in his Coſmography hath another relation, alchough perhaps derived from the Poem of Tertullian, thar acandle burnivg {\wimmeth, but if extinguiſhed finketh. Some more moderately, as Joſephus, and many other ; affirming onely that living bodies floate, nor peremptory averring they cannot ſinke, but that in- deed they doe not eaſily deſcend. Moſt traditionally, as Galen, Pliny, Solinus and Strabo , who ſeemes to miſtake the Lake Serbonis for itz few experimentally, molt contenting themſelves in the experiment ot Veſpaſian, by whoſe command ſome captives bound were caſt there- inand found to floate as though they could have ſwimmed : divers contradicorily, or contrarily, quite overthrowing the point. Ariſtotle inthe ſecond of his Meteors ſpeaks lightly thereof, «#4 wuv0a0y%07, and eſteemeththereof as a fable. Biddulphus devidetia the common ac- counts of Judea into three parts, the one ſaith he are apparent truths, the ſecond apparent falſhoods,the third are dubious or betweene both, in which forme hee ranketh the relation of this Lake. But Andrew Thevet in his Coſmography doth ocularly overthrow it; for hee affic-
of theſe relations ſo different or contrary unto each other , the ſecond is moſt moderate, and ſafeſt to be embraced, which faith, that living
|
bodies ſwim therein, that is, they doe not cafily ſinke : and this, untill exa& experiment further determine,may be allowed,as beft conſiſtent withthis quality, and the reaſons alledged for it. |
As for the cauſe of this effeR, common opinion conceives itto bee the ſalt and bituminous thickneſſe ofthe water. This indeed is pro- | bable, and may bee admitted as farre as the ſecond opinion concea- deth, For, certain it is that ſalt water will ſupport a greater burden then freſh, and we daylic ſec an egge "_ deſcend in ſaltwater, _

will ſwimme in brine. But chat Icon fhould floate therein, from this cauſe is hardly granted 3 for heavy bodies will onely ſwim in that | liquor, wherein the weight of their bulke exceedeth not the weight
offo much water as it occupieth or taketh up. But ſurely no water is heavy enough to anſwer the ponderofity of Iron; and therefore thar metall will finke in any kinde thereof, and it was a perfeRt miracle which was wrought this way by Eliſha. Thus wee perceive that bo- dies doe ſwim or finke indifferent liquors, according unto the tenuity or gravity of thoſe liquors which are to ſupport them. So ſale water beareth that weight which will finke in vineger , vineger that which will fall in freſh water , freſh water that which will finke in ſpirits of Wine, and that will ſwimme in ſpirits of Wine which will finke in clecreoyle , as wee made experiment inglobes of waxe pierced with light ſticks to ſupport them. So that although it be conceived an hard matter to finke in oyle, I belceve a man ſhould finde it very ditiiculr, and next to flying to ſwimme therein. And thus will Gold ſwimin | Quickſilver, wherein Iron and other metals finke ; for the bulke of Gold is onely heavier then that ſpace of Quickſilver which it contai- | neth; and thus alſo in afolution of one ounce of Quickſilver in two of | Aque forts, the liquor will beare Amber, horne and the ſofcer kinds
ot ſtones, as we have made triail in each.
But a private opinion there is which crofſeth the common conceit, maintained by ſome of late, and alledged of old by Srrabo, thar is, that the floating of bodies in this Lake proceeds not from the thickneſle of the water, but a bituminousebullition from the bottome, whereby it
| wafts up bodies injeRed , and ſuffereth them not eafily to finke. The
verity thereof would be enquired by ocular exploration, for this way
is alſo probable ; ſo we obſerve, it is hard to wade deep in baths where
ſprings ariſe, and thus ſometime are bals made to play upon a ſpouting ſtreame.
And therefore, untill judicious and ocular experiment confirme or diſtinguiſh the aſſertion, that bodies doe not ſinke herein at all we doe not yer beleeve ; that they not eafily or with more difficulty deſcend inthis then other water we ſhall already aflent : but to conclude an im- poſkibility from a difficuley, or sffirme whereas things not eaſily ſinke, they doe not drowne at all ; beſide the fallacy , is a frequent addition in humane expreſſion, and an amplification not unuſuall as well in opi- nions as in relations; which oftentimes give indiſtin accounts of proximities , and without reſtraint tranſcend from one unto another. | Thus for as much as the torrid Zone was conceived exceeding hot,and of difficult habitation , the opinions of men ſo advanced its conſtitu- tion, as to conceive the ſame unhabitable, and beyond poſſibility for man to live therein. Thus, becauſe there are no Wolves in England, nor have beene obſerved for divers generations, common people have

And although Ariſtotle and his adherents doe cut off the one, who conceive no efteQuall ejaculation in women, yet in de- fence of the other they cannot be introduced : For, as he delivercth, the inordinate longitude of the organ, though in its proper recipient, may be a meanes to improlificate the ſeed, ſurely the diſtance of place, with the commixture of an aqueous body, muſt prove an effeRuall im. pediment, 8: utterly prevent the {uccefſe of a conception. And therfore that conceit concerning the daughters of Lot,that they were impregna- ted by their ſleeping father,or conceived by ſeminalpollution received at diſtance from him,wil hardly be admitted. And therfore what is re- lated of Divels,and the contrived deluftons of wicked ſpirits,that they ſteale the ſeminall emiſſions of man, and tranſmit them into their vota- ries in coition, is. much to be ſuſpeHGed, & altogether to be denyed, that there enſue conceptions thereupon, however husbanded by Arc, and the

Thiſtles, is fomething ſtrange. For, if an indiflerent and unridiculous objeR could draw his habituall auſterenefle untoa ſmile, it will bee hard to beleeve hee could with perpetuity refiſt the motives thereof: for the aR of langhter which is a ſweet contraRiion of ihe muſcles of the face , and apleaſant agitation of the vocall organs, is not meerely voluntary, or totally within the juriſdiRion of our ſelves: but as it may be conſtrained by corporall contaRion in any , and hath beene enforced in ſome even in their death z ſo the new unuſuall or unexpeRed jucundities , which preſent themſelves to any man in his life , at ſometime or other will have aRivity enough to cxcitate the earthicſt ſoule, and raiſe a ſmile from moſt compoſed tempers. Cer- fainely the times were dull when theſe things happened , and the wirs of thoſe Ages ſhort of theſe of ours , when men could maintaine ſuch immutable faces , as to remaine like ſtatues under the flatteries of wit, and perſiſt unalterable at all effortes of Jocularity. The ſpirits in hell, and Pluto himſelfe , which Lucian makes to laugh at paſſages upon earth, will plainely condemne theſe Saturnines, and make ridiculous che magnified Heraclitus, who wept prepoſterouſly , and made a hell onearth , for rejeRing the conſolations of life , he paſſed his dayes in teares, and the uncomfortable attendments of hell.
3- The ſame conceit there paſſcth concerning our bleſſed Saviour, and is ſometimes urged as an high example of gravity. And this is opinioned, becauſe in 7 Scripture it is recorded he ſometimes wept, butnever that he laughed. Which howſoever granted, it will be hard eo conceive how he paſſed his younger yeares and childhood without 2 {mile if as Divinity affirmeth, for the aſſurance of his humanity unto men, and the concealement of his Divinity from the Divell , he paſſed this age like other children, and ſo proceeded untill he evidenced the ſame. And my no danger there is to affirme the aR or performance of that, whereof we acknowledge the power and cflentiall property ; and whereby indeed hee moſt neerely convinced the doubt of his hu- manity. Nor need we be afraid to aſcribe that unto the incarnate Son, which ſometimes is attributed unto the uncarnate Father , of whom it is aid, He that dwelleth in the heavens ſhall laugh the wicked to ſcorn. For, a laugh there isof contempt or indignation, as well as of mirth and Jocofiry z And that our Saviour was not exempted from, the
hereof, that is, the paſſion of anger, regulated and rightly or- dered by reaſon, the Schosles do not deny : and beſides the experience of the money-changers, and Dove-ſcllers in the Temple, is teſtified by S.John when heſaith , the ſpeech of David was fulfilled in our Saviour. &.5
Now the Alogie of this opipion confiſteth inthe illation , it being not reaſonable to conclude from Scripture negatively in points which are not mattersof faith,and pertaiping unto ſalvation; and therefore al-

And alſo from his education , for as the ſtory ſpeakes it , he was inſtruRted in the Arabian learning , and afterward exerciſed himſclfe therein : Now Arabian learning was ina manner all the liberall Sciences , eſpecially the Mathematicks, and naturall Philoſophy ; wherein not many Ages before him , there flouriſhed | Avicenoa, Averrhoes, Avenzoar, Geber , Almanzor and Alhazen

Of affinity hereto is that conceit of Ovam decumanum , fo cal- led, becauſe the tenth cgge is bigger then any other, according unto. the reaſon alledged by Feſtus, Decumaens ovs dicuntar, quiz ooum decimuwm majue naſcitar.

For, ſurely the conceit isnumerall , and though not in the ſence apprehended, relateth unto the number of ten, as Franciſcue Syl. viws hath moſt probably declared. For, whereas amongſt ſimple | numbers or Digits, the number of ten is the greateſt, therefore what- ſoever was the greateſt inevery kinde, might in ſome ſence be named from this number. Naw, becauſc alſo that which was the greateſt,was metaphorically by ſome at firſt called Decumenxs, therefore whatſoe. ver paſſed under this name was literally concei\ :d by others to reſpeR and make good this number, | The conceit is alſo Latin, for the Greeks to expreſſe the greateſt | wave, do uſe the number of three, that is, the word ws, which is a concurrence of three waves in one, whence aroſe the proverb, wiz | z=x97, or a trifluQuation of evils, which Eraſmus doth render, Malo | ram flutus Decumanus, And thus, although the termes be very diffe-}
rent, yet arethey made to fignifie the ſelfe ſame thing ; the number of tento explaine the number of three,and the fingle number of one wave the colleRive concurrence of more.

For, in the Olympick games, for the ſpace of a furlong , he carryed an Oxe of foure yeares upon his ſhoulders; and the ſame day hee car- ried it in his belly ; for as it is there delivered he cate it up himſclfe: Surely he had beene a proper gueſt at Grandgoufiers feaſt , and might have matcht his throat that cate fixe pilgrims for a ſalad.

Were the ſtory true, they would have made | the onely Diſciples for Zeno and the Stoicks, and might perhaps have
beene perſwaded to laugh in Phaleris his Bull.

| Book 7, vinicy is an argument of things unlcene, and a ſtable aſſent unto things incvident, upon authority of the divine Revealer; So the belicfe of man which depends upon humane Teſtimony, is but a ſtaggering al- ſent unto the afficmative, not without ſome feare of the negative. And as there is required the Spirit of God, and an infuſed inclination unto the one, ſo muſt the actuall ſenſation of our ſenſes, at leaſt the non op- poſition of our reaſons procure our aflent & acquieſcence inthe other, So when Euſebius an holy writer afficmeth there grew a ſtrange and unknowne plant neere the ſtatue of Chriſt,ereRed by his hemarroidall patient inthe Goſpel , which attaining unto the hemne of his veſture, acquired a ſudden faculty to cure all diſeaſes. Although he ſaith he ſaw the ſtatua in hisdayes, hath it found in many men ſo much as hu- mane belicte, ſome believing, others opinioning, a thicd ſuſpeRing it might be otherwiſe. For, indeed in matters of belicfe the underſtan- ding aſſenting unto the relation, either for the authority of the pec- ſon, or the probability of the obje z although there may be a confi- dence of the one, yet if there be not a ſatisfaRion in the other, there will ariſe ſuſpenſions 5 nor can we properly believe untill ſome argu- ment of rea{on, or of our proper ſenſe convince or determine our du- bitations.
- And thus it is alſo in matters of certain and experimented truth: for, if unto one that never heard thereof, a man ſhould undertake to per- ſwade the affecRions of the Loadſtone , or that Jet and Amber attra- eth ſtrawes and light bodics, there would be little Rhetorick in the authority of Ariſtotle, Pliny, or any other. Thus, although it be true that the ſtring of a Lute or Violl will ſtirce upon the ſtroake of an uni- ſon or Diapazon in another of the ſame kinde z that Alcanna being / ereene, will ſuddenly infe& the nailes and other parts with a durable | red'; thata candle out of a Musket will pierce through an inch board, or an Urinall force a naile through a-planke, can few or none belicyc thus much without a viſible experiment, Which notwithſtanding fals out more happily for knowledge; for thele relations leaving uaſatil- faction in the hearers, doe ſtirre up ingenuous dubiofities unto cxpe- riment, and by an explorationof all, prevent deluſion in any.

2. While we laugh at the ſtory of Pygmaleon, and receive as a fable that he fell in love with a ſtatuaz wee cannot but feare it may bee true, what is delivered by Herodotus concerning the Zgyptian Pol- linRors, or ſuch as annointed the dead , that ſome thereof were found in the aR of carnality with them ; from wits that ſay 'tis more then in- continency for Hylas to ſport with Hecuba, and youth to flame inthe frozen embraces of age, we require a name forthis: whercin Petroni- us or Martiall cannot relieve us. The tyranny of Mezentius did nevet equall the vitiofity of this Incubus, that could embrace corruprtion,and make a Miſtreſle of the grave ; that could not reſiſt the dead provoca- tions of beauty , whoſe quick invitements ſcarce excuſe ſubmiſſon. Surely, it ſuch depravities there be yet alive, deformity need not de- ſpaire z nor will the eldeſt hopes be ever ſuperannuated , fince death hath ſpurres, and carcaſſes have beene courted.
3. Iamheartily forry and wiſh it were not true, what tothe diſho- nour of Chriſtianity is affirmed of the Italian, who after he had in- veigled his enemy to diſclaime his faith for the redemption of his life, did preſently poyniard him, to prevent repentance, and aſſure his cter- nall death, The villany of this Chriſtian exceeded the perſccution of Heathens , whoſe malice was never fo imanus as to reach the ſoule of their enemies, or to extend unto the exile of their Ely- fiums. And though the blindnefle of ſome feritics have ſavaged on the dead, and beene ſo injurious unto wormes, as to diſenterre the bo- dies of the deceaſed ; yet had they therein no defigne upon the ſoule ; and have beene ſo farre from the deſtruRion of that, or deſires of a
death, that for the ſatisfaRion of their revenge they wiſhe them many ſoulcs, and were it in their power would have reduced them unto life againe. It is great depravity inour natures, and ſurely an affeRion that ſomewhat ſavoureth of hell, todefire the ſociety, or comfort our ſelves inthe fellowſhip of others that ſuffer with us ; but to procure the miſcries of others in thoſe extremitics, wherein we hold an hope to have no ſociety ourſelyes, is methinks a ſtraine above Lu- cifer, and a projeR beyond the primary ſeduction of Hell, 4. I ſt is not true, and ſome indeed have ſtrongly denyed, what is recorded of the Monke that poyſoned Henry the Emperour , ina
draught of the holy Euchariſt. *Twas a ſcandalous wound unto Chri-
ſtian Religion, and I hope all Pagans will forgive it , when they as

reade that a Chriſtian was poyſoned in a cup of Chiiſt, and received his bane in a draught of his ſalyation. Had I believed Tranſubſtantia- tion, I ſhould have doubted the effeR; and ſurely the finne it ſelfe re- ceived an aggravation in that opinion. It much commendeath the In- nocency of our forefathers , and the ſimplicity of thoſe times, whoſe Laws could never dreame ſo high a crime as parricide : whereas this atthe leaſt may ſceme to outreach that faR, and to exceed the regular diſtinRions of murder. I will not ſay what finng it was to a& it; yet may it ſeemea kinde of martyrdome to ſuffer by it : For, although un- knowingly he dyed for Chriſt his ſake, and loſt his life in the ordained teſtimony of his death. Certainely, had they knowne it, ſome noble zeales would ſcarcely have refuſed it , rather adventuring their owne death, then refuſing the memoriall of his.
Many other accounts like theſe we meet ſometimes in hiſtory, ſcan- dalous unto Chriſtianity, and even unto humanity z whoſe verities not onely, but whoſe relations honeſt minds doe deprecate. For of finnes heteroclitall , and ſuch as want cicher name or preſident, there is oft | times a ſinne even in their hiſtories. We deſire no records of ſuch en- | ormities z ſinnes ſhould be accounted new, that ſo they may be eſtee- med monſtrous. They omit of monſtroſicy as they fall from their ra- rity for, men count it veniall to erre with their forefathers, and foo- liſhly conceive they divide a finnein its ſociety. The pens of men may ſufficiently expatiate without theſe ſingularities of Villany z For, as they encreaſe the hatred of vice in ſome,{o doe they enlarge the theory | of wickedneſſe inall. And this is one thing that may make latter Ages worſe then were the former ; For, the vicious examples of Ages paſt, poyſon the curioſity of cheſe preſent , affording a hint of fin unto ſe- duceable ſpirits, and ſolliciting thoſe unto the imitation of them, whoſe heads were never ſo perverſcly principled as to invent them, In this kinde we commend the wiſdome and goodneſſe of Galen, who would not leave unto the world too ſubtile a Theory of poyſons ; unarming thereby the malice of venemous ſpirits, whole ignorance muſt be con- rented with Sublimate and Arſenick. For, ſurely there arefubtiler ve- nenations, ſuch as will inviſibly deſtroy, and like the Baſilisks of hea-
niable part of things loft ; wherein there muſt never riſe a Pancirollus, nor remaine any Regiſter but that of hell.
And yet, if as ſome Stoicks opinion, and Seneca himſelfediſpu- teth, theſe unruly affeRions that make us ſinne ſuch prodigies, and
ſtory of Snakes in theſe. And if the tranſanimation of Pythagoras or |
