Voice Agents
Realtime Agents

Voice Agents use OpenAI speech-to-speech models to provide realtime voice chat. These models support streaming audio, text, and tool calls and are great for applications like voice/phone customer support, mobile app experiences, and voice chat.

The Voice Agents SDK provides a TypeScript client for the OpenAI Realtime API.

By using speech-to-speech models, we can leverage the model’s ability to process the audio in realtime without the need of transcribing and reconverting the text back to audio after the model acted.
